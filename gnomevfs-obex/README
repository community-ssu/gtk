Extra package for extentions to GnomeVFS. Contains an OBEX module, VFS
DBUS daemon, modified file module that notifies file modifications over
DBUS.

Note that if you're not using the standard dbus system bus address, you
need to set the environment variable DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS to the path
to the system dbus address to use, e.g:

export DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket

for example in the login script.

If the variable is not set, the OBEX module will fallback to the
standard name in $(localstatedir), e.g. /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket.
