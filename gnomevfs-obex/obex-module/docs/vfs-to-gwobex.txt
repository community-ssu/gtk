Mapping between GnomeVFS API and gwobex calls
---------------------------------------------

This is a brief description on which OBEX calls a GnomeVFS call will
result in, to make it easier to figure out which type of errors should
be expected. It is also mentioned when local files are accessed, and
therefore local file errors can be expected.


All methods in the GnomeVFS OBEX method potentially call gw_obex_setup,
if the connection is not setup yet.

gnome_vfs_read, gnome_vfs_write, gnome_vfs_seek, gnome_vfs_tell: These
only work on local temporary files, so they will return any error codes
that the local file module can do.

gnome_vfs_directory_close, gnome_vfs_directory_read: These don't perform
any OBEX or local file actions.

All the following methods also potentially call gw_obex_chdir, unless
the current directory is already the correct one.

gnome_vfs_open: Calls gw_obex_get_fd. It can also return errors
from opening or creating a local temporary file.

gnome_vfs_create: Creates a local file.

gnome_vfs_close: Calls gw_obex_put_file.

gnome_vfs_directory_open: Calls gw_obex_read_dir.

gnome_vfs_get_file_info: Calls gw_obex_read_dir.

gnome_vfs_make_directory: Calls gw_obex_mkdir.

gnome_vfs_remove_directory: Calls gw_obex_read_dir and gw_obex_delete

gnome_vfs_unlink: Calls gw_obex_delete

gnome_vfs_move: Calls gw_obex_move

gnome_vfs_set_file_info: Calls gw_obex_move
