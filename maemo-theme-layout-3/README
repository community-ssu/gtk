This is the theme support package for maemo 3
---------------------------------------------

This package contains a number of tools and data files that can be
used to easily created themes that are compatible with the maemo
platform version 3.

The available tools are

 - maemo-theme-install-3

 - maemo-theme-make-template-3

 - maemo-theme-make-package-template-3

The basic tool for creating a theme for maemo 3 is
'maemo-theme-install-3'.  This program will create a directory that
can be dropped into /usr/share/themes on a maemo device.  You would
normally put this directory into a suitable Debian package.  A
template for such a package can be created with
maemo-theme-make-package-template-3.

Gtk+ themes for the maemo platform usually are graphics intensive;
they are mainly defined by a number of small images that are displayed
in different ways by the Gtk+ widgets.  Using maemo-theme-install
allows you to specify your own images, the colors that are used in
certain areas, and the fonts used to display various texts.  It does
not allow you to change the layout of widgets, or use a theme engine
other than sapwood, or other more advanced things.

The images for a theme are defined by a single big template image and
a list of coordinates.  Maemo-theme-install-3 will cut out parts of the
big image to produce the image files that are referenced by the gtkrc
files.

In addition to the gtkrc files and the associated images,
maemo-theme-install will also create suitable themring information for
the matchbox window manager.
