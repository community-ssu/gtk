# OSSO WIDGET LOOK PROBLEMS
# 
# - Gtk scales _images_ instead of _widgets_ being scaled according
#   to image size.  Widgets are scaled according layout and the internal
#   widget layout/size is according to hardcoded widget code.
#   If you don't let images to be stretched, they might be clipped
#   (e.g. checkbox) or drawn partly outside parent widget (e.g. arrows).
# - Style definitions are theme engine specific.
# - Focus is always shown on the editable part of the widget,
#   not on the label beside the editable part.  On menus also
#   the arrow is highlighted.
#
#
# OSSO WIDGET PROBLEMS
#
# - Menubar widget has to be made into a menu itself.
# - Different button styles and different look for buttons
#   when there are several buttons in a row.
#
#
# POSITIVE SIDE
#
# - Lots of widgets.
# - Can use any images (any style).
# - Color can be changed also for images if one uses
#   grayscale images (recolorable attribute).
# - Anything can have focus and everything is keyboard navigatable,
#   keyboard bindings are changable.
# - Accessibility framework (untested).
# - Input methods (untested).
#
# TODO
# - Scale the arrow images to such size that you can tell
#   Gtk not to scale them.
#
# When creating a new style, include a "osso-" -prefix to it.

# ABOUT STYLES
#
# The way that multiple RC styles bound to the same 
# widget are prioritized is that RC styles bound with 
# widget take precedence over RC styles bound with 
# widget_class, which, in turn, take precedence over 
# RC styles bound with class. For multiple declarations 
# of the same type, later declarations take precedence 
# over earlier ones.
