#Description: Python wrappers around BlueZ
# PyBlueZ is an effort to create python wrappers around bluez to allow python
# developers to use system bluetooth resources. PyBluez works on machines
# running the GNU/Linux operating system and the bluez bluetooth stack. 
# .
# This package does not contain PyBlueZ itself, but simply depends on
# pythonX.Y-xmms where X.Y is the current Debian default Python version.  Unless
# you want to use PyBlueZ with a specific Python version, this is the right
# package to install
