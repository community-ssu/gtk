PyBluez

http://org.csail.mit.edu/pybluez

REQUIREMENTS:
 - python 2.3
 - python-dev
 - BlueZ libraries


INSTALLATION:

  # python setup.py install

  When building on iPAQs for Familiar Linux, you'll need to munge setup.py and
  have it link against libsdp.  This is because Familiar uses a super-old
  version of bluez.

DOCUMENTATION:
  # doc/gendoc

  API documentation will then be located at doc/bluetooth.html and
  doc/_bluetooth.html for low-level access
