Description: FreeDesktop.org shared MIME database and spec
 This is the shared MIME-info database from the X Desktop Group. It is required
 by any program complying to the Shared MIME-Info Database spec, which is also
 included in this package.
 .
 At this time, only ROX uses this database. GNOME and KDE are expected to
 follow soon, and hopefully others too.
