NOTES ABOUT MAEMO INTEGRATION
=============================

To build a debian package, the debian/__installed__.py must be included in the
build dir. Unfortunately, the installation tool included does not create this
by itself unless it is actually installed. So, to allow builds without
installing, a '/usr' prefixed __install__.py is provided, which will work for
the Maemo environment.
