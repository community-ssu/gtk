Gazpacho 
========

Author: Lorenzo Gil Sanchez <lgs@sicem.biz>

This program allows you to create the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of your
GTK+ program in a visual way. It started as a Glade-3 clone but now it is more
complete and featured than its ancestor. It tries to be compatible with libglade
but it can handle some widgets that still lack support in libglade.

Gazpacho is also part of Gruppy, an LGPL'ed framework and set of tools to build
ERP-like software systems for medium and small sized companies. Nevertheless it is
not dependent of any part of it so you can use it by its own.

Gazpacho's homepage is located at:
http://gazpacho.sicem.biz

It's sourcecode is avaliable through a subversion repository at:
