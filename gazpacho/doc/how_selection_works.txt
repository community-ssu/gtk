There are two ways the user can select a widget:

  - Clicking on it directly on the Window it's located (the interface the user
  is designing)

  - Clicking on it in the WidgetTree (ProjectView)

When a widget is selected 3 things usually happens:

  1. A rectangle is painted on top of it with 4 small solid rectangles in the squares so there is some visual feedback for the user

  2. The entry in the WidgetTree for this widget is selected

  3. The Editor is updated to show this widget's properties

The selected widget is stored in the Project object


Selecting a widget from the WidgetTree (ProjectView)
----------------------------------------------------
When a row of the TreeView is selected the TreeViewSelection object associated
emits the 'selection_changed' signal and the '_selection_changed_cb' method
is called. This will tell the Project object that some widget should be
selected by calling 'selection_set' with this widget.

When this happens the Project emits the 'selection_changed' again but in
the ProjectView it is ignored since we know that we triggered ourselves (this
is acomplished by using an extra '_updating_selection' boolean flag)


Selecting a widget by clicking on it
------------------------------------
In GTK+ not every widget can get click events (it depends on if it has a
Gdk Window associated with it). So selecting a widget by clicking on it is
not trivial. The algorithm (copied from Glade-3) is this one:

1.- Get the events coordinates as top_x and top_y and the toplevel window of
    the widget that got the event. Set C = toplevel
2.- For every child of C do:

    2.1.- See if we clicked on that widget comparing relative coordinates
    
    2.2.- If we clicked on a widget and that widget is a container 
    Set C = this_widget and recurse to 2

    2.3.- If we found any child widget that was clicked that's the selected
    widget, otherwise take the parent container.

The we call 'selection_set' on the project which handles everything else.


What 'selection_set' does?
--------------------------
As you have seen both methods at the end call 'selection_set' to select the
widget. This is what this methods does:

1. - If the widget is already selected (has nodes) don't do anything
2. - Else, clear the selection and add this widget to the selection:

   2.1. - Set the nodes on the widget
   2.2  - Emit the 'selection_changed' signal so the Editor and the WidgetTree
   can update themselves. This signal is catched by the Application who takes
   care of updating the editor. It's also catched by the WidgetTree who first
   detect if it really needs to update itself.
