	Added FIXMEs

	Volume comment update.

	Emit "volumes-changed" signal in row-inserted/row-deleted handlers
	too if root node is being inserted or deleted. Fixed a few comments.

	gtk_file_system_memory_tree_iter_to_file_path() was returning
	"" instead of "/" for root node. Also fixed the function's comment. 

	Added back appended-hack to have backwards compatibility if row
	wasn't inserted with gtk_tree_store_append/insert_with_values().

	* gtkfilesystemmemory/gtkfilesystemmemory.c,
	  gtkfilesystemmemoryprivate.h:
	"row-*" signals are connected to only once now per model.
	"row-changed" append hack removed.

	* gtkfilesystemmemorypublic/gtkfilesystemmemorypublic.c: Private API
	for deletion changed. Implement the new way.

	* gtkfilesystemmemorypublic/gtkfilesystemmemorypublic.c
	(gtk_file_system_memory_tree_iter_to_file_path): Changed the code
	to be more understandable

	N#21990 Unable move bookmarks with ä or ö
	
	* gtkfilesystemmemory.c (g_unescape_uri_string): Be less strict on
	what ASCII characters to accept escaped, since g_filename_to_uri()
	escapes quite a many of them.
	
	(gtk_file_system_memory_path_to_uri): Use g_filename_to_uri() to
	escape the filename if needed.
