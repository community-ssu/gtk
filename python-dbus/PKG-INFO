Description: D-BUS is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to
        talk to one another.
        
        D-BUS supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware device
        added" or "printer queue changed") and a per-user-login-session daemon (for
        general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the message bus is built on
        top of a general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any
        two apps to communicate directly (without going through the message bus daemon).
        Currently the communicating applications are on one computer, but TCP/IP option
        is available and remote support planned.
