This is osso-application-installer, version 4
---------------------------------------------

Osso-application-installer is a program to manage user package in the
OSSO platform.  It uses the system-wide package management tools (thru
libapt-pkg) and presents a 'end user oriented' interface to them.

The package management tools are powerful enough to manage the whole
system, but osso-application installer is not intended to offer that
power to the user.  If you want it, synaptic is quite easy to compile
and runs reasonable well on the 770...

Osso-application-installer is intended to be fully compatible with
existing and future interfaces for package management.  It should be
possible to, for example, freely alternate between apt-get, synaptic
and osso-application installer and not have anything break.
