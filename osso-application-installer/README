This is osso-application-installer, version 4
---------------------------------------------

[ About versions:

  1.x initial 'prototype'

  2.x working version of 1.x series with app-installer tool

  3.x intermediate version with the UI of 2.x that uses system-wide
      package management tools

  4.x completely new design that uses libapt-pkg and repositories
]

The osso-application-installer is a program to manage user packages in
the OSSO platform.  It uses the system-wide package management tools
(thru libapt-pkg) and presents a 'end user oriented' interface to
them.

The package management tools are powerful enough to manage the whole
system, but osso-application installer is not intended to offer that
power to the user.  If you want it, synaptic is quite easy to compile
and runs reasonable well on the 770...

Osso-application-installer is intended to be fully compatible with
existing and future interfaces for package management.  It should be
possible to, for example, freely alternate between apt-get, synaptic
and osso-application installer and not have anything break.


Design notes
------------

First phase: wild experimentation with libapt-pkg and widget writing
for Gtk+.  No design whatsoever.

The libapt-pkg specific code is written in C++, but most of the GUI
code should be plain C to enable easier transportation into external
libraries or reuse.  This is not an object oriented program, but we'll
use STL without prejudice.
