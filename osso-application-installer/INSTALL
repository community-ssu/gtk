The usual way to install osso-application-installer is to build a .deb
package and install that but you can also install from source.

Hit-and-run instructions:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  # make install

Via .deb:

  $ ./configure
  $ make deb
  # dpkg --install osso-application-installer_<version>_<arch>.deb

After checking out the sources you need to run ./autogen.sh before the
steps above.
