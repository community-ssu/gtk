/** General dialog helpers

  The following functions construct and show different kinds of
  dialogs.  They do not wait for the user to answer these dialog;
  instead, you need to provide a callback that will be called with the
  result.  This callback is called the 'continuation'.  Continuations
  have a void* parameter, usually called DATA, that can be used in the
  usual fashion to pass arbitrary additional information to it.

  The dialogs are application modal.

  PUSH_DIALOG_PARENT and POP_DIALOG_PARENT are used to keep track of
  the top-most window to be used as the parent for new dialogs.
  GET_DIALOG_PARENT returns that window.

  ASK_YES_NO shows QUESTION in a confirmation note.  The result RES
  passed to the continuation CONT is true when the user clicks "Ok",
  of course, and false otherwise.

  ASK_CUSTOM is like ask_yes_no but allows the texts in the buttons to
  be specified.

  ASK_YES_NO_WITH_DETAILS is like ask_yes_no but it constructs a real
  dialog with title TITLE and adds a third button, "Details".
  Clicking this button opens the "Details" dialog with the given
  package info PI and hint INSTALLED.  See show_package_details for
  the meaning of PI and INSTALLED.

  ANNOY_USER display TEXT in a information note.  Clicking "Ok"
  removes that information note.  No continuation can be specified.

  ANNOY_USER_WITH_DETAILS is like annoy_user but adds a "Details"
  button like ask_yes_no_with_details.

  ANNOY_USER_WITH_LOG is the same as annoy_user.  It used to add a
  "Log" button that would open the log dialog.  This "Log" button is
  no longer used in order not to push the scary log into the face of
  the user too much.  The code, however, still uses
  annoy_user_with_log in preference to annoy_user when showing an
  error message where the log is expected to contain more details.

  ANNOY_USER_WITH_ERRNO shows a notification that is appropriate for
  the given errno value ERR.  The DETAIL string will be put into the
  Log together with a detailed error message.

  If a 'annoy_user' dialog is already active when any of the
  annoy_user function is called, no new dialog is displayed.

  IRRITATE_USER shows TEXT in a information banner which goes away
  automatically after a certain time.

  SCARE_USER_WITH_LEGALESE shows one of two legal disclaimers,
  depending on the SURE parameter.  When SURE is true, the disclaimer
  reflects the fact that you know for sure that the user is about to
  install uncertified software.  Setting SURE to false means that the
  software might or might not be certified.  CONT is called with RES
  set true when the user agrees to take the risk of installing
  uncertified software.

/** Progress indicator

  There is a single global progress indication dialog that can be
  shown or hidden.  The dialog is application modal and has a "Cancel"
  button.  The progress bar can either pulse or show a 'completed'
  fraction.

  The dialog will be shown when calling SHOW_PROGRESS but also
  automatically when a status report from the apt-worker comes, except
  when that status report is for op_updating_cache.  To be prepared
  for this automatic showing, you should use
  set_general_progress_title and reset_progress_was_cancelled at the
  right time.

  XXX - Yes, this logic is ugly and needs to be cleaned up.

  SHOW_PROGRESS shows the progress dialog, resets it to pulsing mode,
  and sets the current operation associated with the dialog to
  op_general (see apt-worker-proto.h).  The TITLE given in the call to
  show_progress is used whenever the current operation is op_general.

  SET_GENERAL_PROGRESS_TITLE can be use to set the title used for
  op_general without causing the dialog to show.

  SET_PROGRESS sets the displayed progress to relfect that ALREADY
  units out of TOTAL units have been completed.  When ALREADY is -1,
  however, the prgress bar starts pulsing.  The current operation is
  set to OP.  When it is op_general, the last title given to
  show_progress is used; otherwise, a title appropriate for OP is
  used.  When OP is op_downloading, the unit for TOTAL is taken to be
  bytes and this size is included in the title.

  When the current operation is op_downloading, clicking on the cancel
  button will call cancel_apt_worker (see apt-worker-client.h).
  Otherwise, only an information banner saying "Unableto cancel now.
  Please wait." is shown.

  HIDE_PROGRESS will hide the progress dialog.  Since the dialog is
  application modal, it is important to eventually hide it.
  Otherwise, the application will effectively freeze.

  PROGRESS_WAS_CANCELLED can be used to determine whether
  cancel_apt_worker was indeed called as the response to a click on
  the "Cancel" button (since the last call to show_progress or
  reset_progress_was_cancelled).

  RESET_PROGRESS_WAS_CANCELLED resets the flag to false that tracks
  whether the user has clicked on the "Cancel" button.

   banner is shown whenever that counter is positive.  The actual
   display of the banner is delayed by two seconds so that when the
   counter is positive for less than two seconds, no banner is shown.

   In addition ALLOW_UPDATING and PREVENT_UPDATING maintain a flag and
   the updating banner is only shown when that flag allows it.  The
   flag starts out in the 'allow' state.

   The label shown in the banner is determined by SHOW_UPDATING.
   Using NULL (the default) gives you the standard "Updating" label.
   The label specified with SHOW_LABEL will only be used when the
   banner is created.  Thus, when a banner is already active when you
   call SHOW_UPDATING again, the label is not changed.

/* Global package list widget

  MAKE_GLOBAL_PACKAGE_LIST creates a widget that displays the given

  structs.

  When INSTALLED is true, information about the installed version of a
  package is shown, otherwise the available version is used.

  EMPTY_LABEL is shown instead of a list when PACKAGES is NULL.

  OP_LABEL is the text used for the operation item in the context menu
  or a package.

  the list is selected or activated, respectively.

  XXX - The state of the package list widget is partially stored in
  global variables (that's why the function is called
  make_GLOBAL_package_list).  Thus, you can only use one of these
  widgets at any one time.  This could clearly be improved.

  PACKAGES must remain valid until make_global_package_list is called
  again or until clear_global_package_list is called.

  CLEAR_GLOBAL_PACKAGE_LIST clears the list in the most recently
  constructed package list widget.

  If a package_info struct has been changed and the display should be
  udpated to reflect this, call GLOBAL_PACKAGE_INFO_CHANGED.  You can
  call this function on any package_info struct at any time,
  regardless of whether it is currently being displayed or not.
