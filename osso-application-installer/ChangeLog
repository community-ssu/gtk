	* settings.cc: Removed "clean_after_install" setting from UI.

	* main.h, main.cc, util.cc, apt-worker-proto.h, apt-worker.cc:
	Return short descriptions and icons in the GET_PACKAGE_LIST
	response, not in the GET_PACKAGE_INFO response.  Expect these
	values to always be valid, not only when have_info is true.

	* configure.ac: Include hildon-fm in PKG_CHECK_MODULES since the
	hildon_file_chooser_dialog has been moved from hildon-libs to
	hildon-fm.

        * util.h, util.c (all_white_space): New function.
	
	* src/repo.cc (repo_edit_response): Disallow empty URLs and
	distributions.

	* utils/check-application-for-uninstall.c: Proper parsing of
	command line options.  Look into /proc to find the executable.
	Include application name in dialog.

	Started from scratch, thus no detailed ChangeLog entries until the
	code settles a bit.
