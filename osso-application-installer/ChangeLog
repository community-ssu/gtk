2005-07-28  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@nokia.com>

        Released 2.2-0.
	
	* src/core.c (read_into_string): Use read syscall instead of
	g_io_channel_read_chars since the latter blocks sometimes.  Needs
	more investigation.
	(kb_used_in_var_lib_install): Use statvfs instead of spawning
	"du".  The latter fails surprisingly often.

	* src/ui/interface.h (progress_dialog,
	ui_create_progressbar_dialog, ui_close_progress_dialog,
	ui_set_progress_dialog): New.
	* core.c (installer_callback, installer_progress): Use it, but
	only in the pulsing mode.

	* src/ui/callbacks.h, src/ui/callbacks.c (do_install): New.
	(on_button_install_clicked): Use it.
	* src/dbus.c (dbus_message_handler): Likewise.
	* src/main.c (main): Likewise.
	
2005-07-27  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@nokia.com>

	* configure.ac: Bumped version to 2.1.
	(AITOOLS_CFLAGS, AITOOLS_LIBS): Added gnome-vfs-2.0.
	
	* app-installer-tool/app-installer-tool.c (do_copy): New.

	* src/core.c (run_app_installer_tool): Reimplemented by using
	spawn_app_installer_tool.
	(spawn_app_installer_tool): Take three args for
	app-installer-tool.  Make using sudo optional.  Accept 'line'
	callbacks.  Changed all callers.
	(read_into_string): Call 'line' callbacks as appropriate.
	(kb_used_in_var_lib_install): Log error message in case of
	failure.
	(installer_progress): Deal with errors from
	kb_used_in_var_lib_install.
	(install_package_from_uri): New.

	* src/dbus.c (dbus_message_handler): Use install_package_from_uri
	instead of on_button_install_clicked.
	
	* src/main.c (main): Call install_package_from_uri instead of
	passing it inside app_ui_data.

	* src/ui/callbacks.c (on_button_install_clicked): Use
	install_package_from_uri instead of doing the copying here.  Do
	not look at 'param' from app_ui_data.
	
2005-07-22  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@nokia.com>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Removed wrapper.
	* configure.ac: Do not create wrapper/Makefile.

	* src/ui/interface.c (ui_create_main_dialog): Do not use
	"row-activated" signal of treeview, use "changed" signal of its
	selection.

	* src/ui/callbacks.h, src/ui/callbacks.c (on_treeview_activated):
	Renamed to on_treeview_selection_changed and adapted to be useable
	as a "changed" signal handler for the tree selection.

	
	First round of the big rewrite.  Main things missing: context
	sensitive menu and direct installation from command line argument.
	
	* configure.ac: Changed version to 2.0-0.  Handle
	"--disable-sudo".  Check for the depencies of app-installer-tool.

	* src/core.c, src/core.h: Rewritten, changed everything.

	* src/ui/represent.h, src/ui/represent.c: Removed unused defines.
	(represent_packages): Renamed to update_package_list.  Take
	AppData instead of AppUIData.  Changed all callers.  Deal with
	errors from list_packages.
	(represent_confirmation, represent_dependencies, represent_error,
	represent_notification, show_dialog): Removed.
	(present_report_with_details, confirm_install, confirm_uninstall):
	New.
	
	* src/ui/interface.h, src/ui/interface.c: Removed unused defines.

	ui_pulse_progressbar, ui_create_progressbar_dialog,
	ui_cleanup_progressbar_dialog): Removed.
	(ui_read_selected_package): Also return size.  Do not test for
	special entries to ignore, they are not used anymore.
	(ui_create_main_dialog): Create database_corrupted_label.  Only
	update list of apckages after everything has been created.  This
	allows the list updating to display errors.  Do not set textbuffer
	to MESSAGE_DOUBLECLICK, whatever that was meant to be.  Removed
	code for doing direct install.
	
	* src/ui/callbacks.c, src/ui/callbacks.h (on_treeview_activated):
	Use AppData instead of AppUIData.  Changed all callers.
	(on_button_install_clicked): Only test for "file://" method whend
	deciding whether to copy the file or not.  See the source for a
	rationale.

	* src/main.c (main): Temporarily disabled direct installation.

	* app-installer-tool/app-installer-tool.c: Added prototypes.
	Expanded usage message.
	(setup_environment): Set "LC_ALL" instead of "LANG".
	(do_list): Use "--showformat" instaed of "-f" since the latter is
	not supported by the dpkg-query on the target.
	(do_describe_package): Likewise.
	(parse_field): New.
	(do_describe_file): Use it to provide package name, version and
	size in addition to description.

	"--force-not-root" and "--force-bad-path" options accordingly.
	(do_uninstall): Likewise.

2005-07-21  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@nokia.com>

	* autogen.sh: Use "--copy --force" also with libtoolize and
	"--copy" with autoconf to avoid symlinks in the source tree.

	* app-installer-tool/Makefile.am,

	* make-package: Expect location of debian/ directory as argument.
	* Makefile.am (DEBIAN, deb): Provide it, in an overridable way.

	* src/Makefile.am (script_DATA): Do not use $(srcdir) here.
	(EXTRA_DIST): New, since script_DATA is not distributed
	automatically.
