	* Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am (DISTCLEANFILES): Added so that
	files created by configure get deleted by "make distclean".

	* src/Makefile.am (script_DATA): Get the files from $(srcdir) to
	enable a VPATH build.

	* control-panel/Makefile.am (CLEANFILES, DISTCLEANFILES): Moved
	.desktop files to DISTCLEANFILES since they are created by
	configure.

	* Imported version 1.0.28 into public repository.
