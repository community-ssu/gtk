	* src/apt-worker-client.h, src/apt-worker-client.cc
	(status_out_of_space, reset_client_error_status,
	client_error_out_of_space): New.

	Use make_boolean_option to add more configuration options in
	red_pill_mode.

	* main.h, main.cc, details.h, details.cc, util.h, util.cc:
	Replaced the old "bool installed" flag for selecting what kind of

	of details were displayed when you first asked for "install
	details", say, and later for "remove details".

	Implemented the artificial "magic:sys" package that represents all

	name, not as a cache iterator.  Use mark_named_package_for_install

	(cmd_install_check, cmd_install_package): Use
	mark_named_package_for_install instead of mark_for_install.
