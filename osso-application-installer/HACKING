Getting started with hacking on the Application Manager
-------------------------------------------------------

You need to install the "fakeroot" package in your Scratchbox in order
to run the Application Manager there.  (It uses fakeroot in SB and
sudo on the device.)

You probably also want to set

    assume-connection 1

in ~/.osso/appinstaller.  Otherwise it will try to use the
Connectivity APIs that are not present.  Run the AM once and then edit
the file.

When building the AM, it will also create a osso-application.run
executable.  This executable doesn't use maemo-launcher and is thus
easier to use for debugging.

If you have changed apt-worker and you want to test it without
installing it, you can give its location as a parameter to
osso-application-installer.

I usually run it like this from .../src/ in Scratchbox:

    run-standalone.sh ./osso-application-installer.run ./apt-worker
