// This is should be large enough for the maemo SDK mistral
// repository.  The average space per package in a normal setup 
// is 250 bytes or so, so 1.6 MB is good for about 6400 packages, give
// or take, which should be enough for everyone.
//
// XXX - Except that some repositories are maintained in such way that
//       need more than 700 bytes per package in the cache.  So we use
//       3 MB, arbitrarily.
