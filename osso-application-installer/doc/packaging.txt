Howto make a package for the Application installer 2006
=======================================================

This is a short guide about how to make packages for the Application
installer of the Internet Tablet OS 2006.

The main point to take away is that the AI 2006 is a graphical
frontend to the standard Debian package management infrastructure,
similar to Synpatic, but aimed at a different clientele.

The AI 2006 uses the same backend tools as Synaptic, Aptitude, or
apt-get (namely libapt-pkg), and it does it in the standard way
without imposing any constraints: packages are installed as root and
can touch the whole system, for example.

The normal way to distribute a package is therefore to put it into
some repository and make it accessible to apt.  See the "Repository
Maintainers Guide" for more information on how to setup such a
repository.

You can freely alternate between AI 2006 and apt-get, say.  Changes
done to the system via apt-get or dpkg are picked up by the AI 2006
without confusing it, and vice versa.

Packages made for the Application 2006 should follow a few extra
rules, tho, if they want to integrate nicely.  These rules are related
to

  - general stuff
  - dependencies
  - sections
  - icons
  - the installation/removal policy of the AI
  - limited feedback to the user, no controlling terminal
  - warning about removing running applications
  - utilities to use in your maintainer scripts


Relationship with Application installer 2005
--------------------------------------------

The Application installer 2006 is very different from the one in
Internet Tablet OS 2005 (IT 2005) and the two are not at all
compatible.  If you have packages that work with IT 2005, you need
to redo their packaging in order to make them work with IT 2006.
This is not really that bad, since IT 2005 and IT 2006 are not
binary compatible with each other and you need to make separate
packages for them anyway.

The Application installer 2005 will reject packages made for 2006 and
vice versa.

The two versions of the AI are visually different and there should be
no risk to confuse the two.  The AI 2005, for example, is a Control
panel applet, and the AI 2006 is a regular application started from
the "Tools" menu.  Also the AI 2006 actually calls itself "Application
manager" on the screen.


General
-------

All strings coming from the control information of a package are
interpreted in UTF-8 when they are shown in the UI.  If a string is
not valid UTF-8, all bytes above 127 are replaced with '?' before
displaying it.


Dependencies
------------

There is nothing special about the "Depends" control field anymore.
It should no longer contain "maemo".  It should now contain all the
real dependencies, like ${shlibs:Depends}, etc.


Sections
--------

By default, the AI 2006 only shows packages in certain sections to the
user.  This has been done to hide the existence of the hundreds of
system packages that make up the IT 2006 itself.  The AI is, at this
point, not intended to let the user manage the whole system, only a
smaller set of third party applications.

The AI only shows packages in the "user" section.  Thus, your
"Section:" field in the control file should be of the form

    Section: user/<SUBSECTION>

where <SUBSECTION> is arbitrary.  <SUBSECTION> should be a nice
capitalised, English word like "Ringtones".  There is no support for
localising that word yet, unfortunately.

However, there is also a predefined set of subsections.  If your
package fits into one of these subsections, you should put it there.
This will avoid fragmenting the subsection names, and the names of
these subsections will be correctly localised.

The list of predefined subsections and their English names is:

    user/accessories    Accessories		   
    user/communication  Communication
    user/games	        Games			   
    user/multimedia     Multimedia		   
    user/office	        Office		   
    user/other          Other                    
    user/programming    Programming		   
    user/support        Support		   
    user/themes	        Themes		   
    user/tools          Tools 		   

Thus, if you want to put your package into the Office subsection,
include the field

    Section: user/office

in your control information.  If you want to put it into "Ringtones"
(which is not pre-defined), use

    Section: user/Ringtones


Icons
-----

A package can have an icon that is displayed next to its name by the
AI.  Icons are included in the control information of a package as a
base64 encoded field named "Maemo-Icon-26".

The image format of the icon can be anything that is understood by
GdkPixbufLoader, but is most commonly the PNG format.

The image should be 26x26 pixels with a transparent background.

Here is an example of a correctly formatted Maemo-Icon-26 field:

Maemo-Icon-26:
 iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABoAAAAaCAYAAACpSkzOAAAABGdBTUEAAK/INwWK6QAAABl0

The way to get these fields into your .deb files is to include them
with a "XB-" prefix in your debian/control file, see the Debian Policy
Manual, section 5.7.


Installation and removal policy
-------------------------------

The Application installer has its own rules for automatically
installing and removing packages in addition to the ones specified by
the user.  These rules are tuned to give little surprises for simple
package management operations, but in turn they are not really useable
for complicated things like "apt-get dist-upgrade".  When designing
the conflicts of your packages, you might want to take these rules
into account.

Specifically, the AI will never automatically remove a user package.

If a conflict caused by installing a package could be resolved by
removing a package, the AI will not do the removal but will refuse the
installation request instead.

When removing a package, all packages that are a direct or indirect
dependency of the removed package will be considered for removal.
They will in fact be removed when they are a non-user package, have
been automatically installed by the AI to satisfy a dependeny, and are
no longer needed.

The AI is not very smart in reporting conflicts: when your package
conflicts with a non-user package, the problem report by the AI will
blame the conflict on that non-user package instead of on the user
packages that depend on it.


Feedback from maintainer scripts
--------------------------------

When the Application installer runs your maintainer scripts, they have
no controlling terminal; their standard input is connected to
/dev/null.  DISPLAY is set correctly, tho.

The Application installer collects a transcript of the
installation/uninstallation process, including the output of
maintainer scripts.  However, this output is hidden away in the "Log",
and you should not expect users to look there and understand its
contents.

Thus, you should try really hard to not fail in your maintainer
scripts.  This does not mean that you should ignore errors, of course,
but that you should only do things that have a very high chance of
succeeding.  The simpler, the better.


Warning about removing/upgrading running applications
-----------------------------------------------------

The Application installer can run a script provided by your package
before removing or upgrading it.  That script can tell the Application
installer to cancel the operation.

The canonical use for this feature is to warn the user when he tries
to remove or upgrade an application that is currently running.  You
can use the utility 'maemo-application-running' to perform this test.
(See below for details.)

When uninstalling or upgrading a package named PACKAGE, the
Application installer will run the program named

    /var/lib/osso-application-installer/info/PACKAGE.checkrm

if it exists.  When this program exist with code 111, the operation is
cancelled.  In all other cases, including when the program terminates
with a signal, the operation is carried out.

The arguments given to the *.checkrm program are either

    foo.checkrm remove

when the package is going to be removed, or

    foo.checkrm upgrade <VERSION>

when it is going to be upgraded to version <VERSION>.


Utilities to use in your maintainer scripts
-------------------------------------------

There are some utilities available that you can use in your maintainer
scripts to interact with the user:

- maemo-select-menu-location <app>.desktop [default-folder]

  When your package contains a .desktop file and consequently has an
  entry in the Desktop menu for this file, it can call
  maemo-select-menu-location in its postinst script to let the user
  choose a location for the entry.

  The "<app>.desktop" parameter is the name of your .desktop file,
  without any directories.  The default-folder parameter is optional,
  and when given determines the default folder of the menu entry.  If
  you omit it, the menu entry will appear in "Extras".

  The way to specify a folder that is provided by the system is by
  giving its logical name as listed in the
  /etc/xdg/menus/applications.menu file, NOT by giving its English
  name.  Example logical names are

    tana_fi_games
    tana_fi_tools
    tana_fi_utilities
  
  If you use a folder name that does not yet exist, it is created.  In
  that case, you should NOT use a logical name, since there will
  likely be no translations available for that logical name.  When
  creating a new folder, use a plain text name in a language that is
  appropriate.  But, try to use existing folders as much as you can.

  Thus, if your package installs the file

    /usr/share/applications/hildon/foo.desktop

  and you want it to go to the "Utilities" menu, you would put this
  invokation into your postinst script:

    maemo-select-menu-location foo.desktop tana_fi_utilities

  If you want it to go into a non-existing folder, use something like

    maemo-select-menu-location foo.desktop "Cute hacks"

  In order to use maemo-select-menu-location in postinst, you should
  Pre-Depend on the "maemo-select-menu-location" package.

  You might want to skip calling maemo-select-menu-location when
  merely upgrading as opposed to installing from scratch.


- maemo-application-running -x executable-file
  maemo-application-running -d <app>.desktop

  This utility checks whether the application specified on the
  commandline is currently running.  If it is running, it exits with
  code 0.  If it is not running, it exits with code 1.  If some error
  occured, it exits with code 2.

  When using the -x option, the utility checks whether any process is
  currently executing that file, by looking into /proc/PID/exe.

  When using the -d option, the utility uses the given .desktop file
  to find the service name of the application und queries D-BUS
  whether this service is currently registered.  If there is no
  service name in the .desktop file, the utility uses the executable
  file as with the -x option.

  [THE -d OPTION HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET.  SORRY.]

  In order to use maemo-application-running in postinst, you should
  Pre-Depend on the "maemo-installer-utils" package.


- maemo-confirm-text [title] file

  Displays the contents of FILE in a dialog with "Ok" and "Cancel"
  buttons.  The default title of the dialog is "License agreement".

  When the user clicks "Ok", this utility exits with code 0; when he
  clicks "Cancel", it exits with code 1; and when an error occurs, it
  exits with code 2.

  If you do in fact show a license agreement in your postinst script,
  it is probably not a good idea to make the postinst script fail when
  the user does not agree to the license terms.  Instead, you could
  configure your application in such a way that it will ask the user
  to agree to the license agreement again when the application is
  started and refuse to run when he disagrees.

  In order to use maemo-confirm-text in postinst, you should
  Pre-Depend on the "maemo-installer-utils" package.


Other utilities
---------------

- maemo-list-user-packages

  Lists all packages that the user can manage with the Application
  installer in this format

    name<TAB>version<TAB>section-field<TAB>installed-size<NL>

  where 'section-field' is the value of the "Section:" field for the
  package.
