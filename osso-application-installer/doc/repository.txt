About Repositories for the Application Installer 2006
=====================================================

Basic repository setup
----------------------

The Application installer can deal with any repository that "apt-get"
can understand.  However, the Application installer only shows 'user'
packages to the user.  A user packages is identified by being in the
"user" section; see the "Packaging HOWTO".

Also, when adding a new repository manually, the Application installer
provides default values for certain parts of a sources.list line.  You
might want to take this into account when laying out your repository
so that users have it easy when configuring it.

The distribution will default to the symbolic name of the distribution
that is installed on the device.  This symbolic name is referred to as
${dist} in the sequel.  For maemo 2.0, this is "mistral".  The
component list defaults to just "user".

Thus, unless you have a specific reason to use something else, it is
probably a good idea to have repositories that can be specified as

    deb URL ${dist} user

so that the user only has to enter URL into the "New Catalogue"
dialog.

How to actually setup a repository is explained in the "Debian
Repository HOWTO".

"Single-click install"
----------------------

THIS FEATURE IS NOT SUPPORTED IN THE IT 2006 RELEASE.

When you want users to be able to browse your repositories using the
Application installer, you need to provide instructions to the user
about how to configure your repository.  On a fundamental level, you
need to tell them what values to put into the "New repository" dialog.

This manual task can be automated by providing a file of MIME type
"application/x-install-instructions" and have the user open it with
the Application installer.  Files with the extension ".install" are
recognized to have the mime type "application/x-install-instructions".

Such a .install file is a text file following the GKeyfile format, as
defined by glib.  An example would look like this:

    [install]
    repo_name = Foo Catalogue
    repo_deb  = deb http://foo.com/maemo mistral user

Thus, it can contain information about a repository, and opening the
file will add the repository to /etc/apt/sources.list if it isn't
there already.  The existence check is based on a simple string
comparison without any intelligence: if you put two spaces in the
"deb" line instead of one, the strings are considered different.  This
test might get smarter in the future.

The .install file can also contain the name of a package, like so:

    [install]
    repo_name = Foo Catalogue
    repo_deb  = deb http://foo.com/maemo mistral user
    package   = foo-app

Opening this file will attempt to install the package named "foo-app",
after adding the specified repository if it is not already configured.
There is no guarantee, tho, that the named package will actually be
downloaded from the given repository.  If the package is available
with a later version from other repositories that are listed in
sources.list, then it will be downloaded from there.

The "repo_name" entry is optional.  If you omit it, the repository
will have no name.  The name of a repository is only used in the UI;
it has no effect on functionality.

The "repo_deb" entry is not optional.  In fact, different releases of
maemo will use different key names so that you can control what
repository to use with what maemo release.  If the expected repo_deb
variant is not found in the .install file, an error message will be
displayed to the user.

Here is a table of the various key names:

   maemo 2.0:  repo_deb
   maemo 3.0:  repo_deb_3


Disabling repositories
----------------------

The Application installer lets the user edit parts of the contents of
/etc/apt/sources.list.  It recognizes lines marked with "deb", "#deb"
and a few special comments (see below) and preserves everything else.
A "deb" line is the usual specification for a source of binary
packages.  A "#deb" line is the same, but disabled.  When
enabling/disabling a repository, the Application installer switches
between the "deb" and "#deb" marker.

There must be no space between "#" and "deb" in the "#deb" marker for
it to be recognized by the Application installer.


Repository names
----------------

THIS FEATURE IS NOT SUPPORTED IN THE IT 2006 RELEASE.

A repository can have a name for easier identification.  Names are
stored in /etc/apt/sources.list as a comment line of the form

    #maemo:name NAME

This declaration applies to the next following 'deb' or '#deb' line.


Marking a repository as essential
---------------------------------

A "deb" or "#deb" line in /etc/apt/sources.list can be marked as
'essential'.  The Application installer will refuse to change or
remove such a line.

The way to mark a line as essential is to put a line of the form
"#maemo:essential" before the line.  The "#maemo:essential" marker
must be on a line of its own, with no whitespace between "#" and
"maemo:essential".  The marker does not have to immediately precede
the "deb" or "#deb" line.


Setting up a repository with certified packages
-----------------------------------------------

The AI can recognize certain parts of repositories as 'certified'.
Packages coming from those parts are installed without showing the big
fat warning dialog to the user.  (But that is the only difference
between certified parts and non-certified ones.)

The way to configure such a certified part is to specify a URI prefix;
all archive files downloaded from a location with that prefix are
considered certified if the corresponding Release file has been signed
and successfully verified.

The Release file can be signed by _any_ key known to apt to be
accepted for a certified part.  This is acceptable since only
known-good public keys are factory-configured and if the attacker has
enough access to the device to configure a key for his dns-spoofed
repository, he has breached the device already from our point of view.

The reason for basing the 'is-certified' test on a URI prefix instead
of on "deb" lines in sources.list, say, or (URI, Distribution,
Component) tuples is simplicity: The URI prefix test can be done very
easily, and without modifying libapt-pkg.  (It might or not might not
be a good idea to use pool/ directories for certified parts of a
repository.  It is probably simpler to not use them.)

The reason that any key is accepted when verifying the signature on
the Release file of a certified part is again simplicity and the
desire not to modify libapt-pkg at this point.  As far as I can see,
libapt-pkg does not remember which keys succeeded in verifying the
signature.  This could be improved in the future.


The list of URI prefixes of certified repository parts is contained in
the file /etc/osso-application-installer/certified.list.  It consists
of lines of the forms

    uri-prefix <uri-prefix>

where <uri-prefix> must not contain whitespace and must match the URI
of a downloaded package literally (i.e., no %xx escape expansion is
done, etc).  Everything after and including the first '#' in a line is
ignored.  Blank lines are allowed, of course.
