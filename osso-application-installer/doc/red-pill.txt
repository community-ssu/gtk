Red pill mode settings
----------------------

After activating the red pill mode, the following additional settings
are available in "Tools > Settings".

 - "Clean apt cache"

   If activated, the equivalent of "apt-get clean" is performed after
   every install or update.  (This is the behavior for blue-pill
   mode.)

 - "Assume net connection"

   This will not ask for an active IAP before downloading.  This is
   useful if you have a network connection, but the 770 connectivity
   APIs are not available or don't know about it.

 - "Break locks"

   This will break needed locks instead of failing.  This is done by
   default in blue pill mode so that users don't lock themselves out
   when a crash leaves a stale lock behind.

 - "Show dependencies"

   This adds another tab to the details dialog with some dependencies
   from the package.

 - "Show all packages"

   This will not filter out packages that are not in the "user"
   section.  It will also allow installing packages from any section.

 - "Show magic system package"

   This will include the "magic:sys" package in the list of packages.
   Updating that package will do something similar to "apt-get
   upgrade".  It is not yet fully defined what it will do exactly.
   This feature might become available in blue-pill mode at one point.
