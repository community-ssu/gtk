	* libcurl.m4: Check that our libcurl has
	curl_version_info(CURLINFO_NOW).

2005-06-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Only do the OS X linker fix on Panther.  Tiger has a
	clean curl-config.

2005-04-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Add a check for curl_free() since older versions of
	libcurl don't have it.  Substitute free() as an alternative.

2005-03-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* readline.m4: Check for completion functionality.

	* ldap.m4: Comments.

2005-03-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* ldap.m4: New.  Moved from configure.ac.

2005-02-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Use $LIBS instead of $LDFLAGS.  This should help
	build problems on Mingw32.

2005-02-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: More comments.

2005-01-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: All versions of curl-config support --feature.

2005-01-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Note that FTPS existed, but wasn't fully
	standards-compliant until version 7.11.0.

2005-01-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Use LIBCURL_CPPFLAGS and not LIBCURL_INCLUDES to
	match automake syntax.

2005-01-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am, libusb.m4: New libusb check macro.

2004-12-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Rewrite this to use the new --protocols flag I gave
	to the libcurl people.

	* Makefile.am: Add readline.m4 and libcurl.m4.

2004-12-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: OSX has a problem with their curl-config script.

	* readline.m4: Make sure that readline is modern enough to
	understand rl_catch_signals.

	* libcurl.m4: Don't require curl-config to be present since it
	seems some binary packages don't include it.  Allow users to
	specify LIBCURL and LIBCURL_INCLUDES for us.

2004-12-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Be much more strict with libcurl by trying to
	compile and link a test program that uses the features that we
	need.

	* libcurl.m4: New.
