gpgv -- signature verification tool

Synopsis
********

     gpgv
      options
      signed files

DESCRIPTION
***********

`gpgv' is the OpenPGP signature checking tool.

   This program is a stripped down version of `gpg' which is only able
to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the full blown `gpg'
and uses a different (and more simple way) to check that the public
keys used to made the signature are trustworth. There is no options
files and only very few options are implemented.

   `gpgv' assumes that all keys in the keyring are trustworty.  It uses
by default a keyring named `trustedkeys.gpg' which is assumed to be in
the home directory as defined by GnuPG or set by an option or an
environment variable. An option may be used to specify another keyring
or even multiple keyrings.

OPTIONS
*******

`gpgv' recognizes these options:

-v, -verbose
     Give more information during processing. If used twice, the input
     data is listed in detail.

-q, -quiet
     Try to be as quiet as possible.

-keyring `file'
     Add `file' to the list of keyrings.  If `file' begins with a tilde
     and a slash, these are replaced by the HOME directory. If the
     filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the
     home-directory ("~/.gnupg" if -homedir is not used).  The filename
     may be prefixed with a scheme:

     "gnupg-ring:" is the default one.

-homedir `directory'
     Set the name of the home directory to `directory' If this option
     is not used it defaults to "~/.gnupg". It does not make sense to
     use this in a options file. This also overrides the environment
     variable "GNUPGHOME".

-status-fd `n'
     Write special status strings to the file descriptor `n'.  See the
     file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of them.

-logger-fd `n'
     Write log output to file descriptor `n' and not to stderr.

-ignore-time-conflict
     GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with keys and
     signatures have plausible values. However, sometimes a signature
     seems to be older than the key due to clock problems. This option
     makes these checks just a warning.

RETURN VALUE
************

The program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 if at least one
signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.

EXAMPLES
********

gpgv `pgpfile'
gpgv `sigfile'
     Verify the signature of the file. The second form is used for
     detached signatures, where `sigfile' is the detached signature
     (either ASCII armored or binary) and are the signed data; if this
     is not given the name of the file holding the signed data is
     constructed by cutting off the extension (".asc", ".sig" or
     ".sign") from `sigfile'.

ENVIRONMENT
***********

HOME
     Used to locate the default home directory.

GNUPGHOME
     If set directory used instead of "~/.gnupg".

FILES
*****

~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg
     The default keyring with the allowed keys
