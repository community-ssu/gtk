Description: Layout and rendering of internationalized text
 Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
 on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
 needed. however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the GTK+
 widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and
 font handling for GTK+-2.0.
 .
 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with
 four different font backends:
  - Core X windowing system fonts
  - Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library
  - Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library
  - Native fonts on Microsoft backends
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.
