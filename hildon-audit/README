Purpose
=======

Hildon-audit is a tool meant to assist the developer in the Chinook API
migration process. Reasons for API break are explained in detail on the
www.maemo.org website:

    http://maemo.org/news/view/1184675758.html

Hildon-audit is a simple source-code scanner. It'll analyze the code and
highlight the parts (lines) that require changes. Smaller changes (syntax
changes) are explained directly in the hildon-audit output. Bigger changes 
are reported with links to web documentation/explanation.

A lot of the API changes are about removing widgets that were already marked as
deprecated in the previous maemo releases. If your application was written
against the latest and greatest Bora API's, chances are you don't need to do
much work.


Usage
=====

Hildon audit tool works with a rule set and a directory (source directory). It
comes with a debian package and after installing the package you can use it in
the following way:

    $ cd your-source-code
    $ hildon-audit /usr/share/hildon-audit/*/*.txt .

This will scan the current working directory (your applicaton directory) with
all the API migration rules. You can also use the tool locally (without the
need to install the package). 

    $ ./hildon-audit data/*/*.txt /your/source/code/directory


Rules files
===========

bora:       Contains rules which can be implemented using the Maemo 3.0 'bora' SDK

sardine:    Contains rules which require bleeding edge packages from Sardine to be
            implemented <http://sardine.garage.maemo.org/>. These changes are going 
            to Chinook platform and SDK release.
