	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-chooser-dialog.c
	(hildon_file_chooser_dialog_get_paths): remove leading dots from
	user provided file names (otherwise files are be hidden by the
	filemanager, and the user has no way to access them.)

2005-08-01  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>

	* hildon-file-selection.c: GtkTreeModelSort didn't keep
	the order very well for equal nodes, therefore a sort 
	function was fixed to handle device nodes correctly.
	
	* hildon-file-system-model.c: Now allowing load_uri to access
	gateway before gateway is accessed by UI.

	* hildon-file-system-settings.[ch]: Added
	_hildon_file_system_settings_ready() for checking if all settings
	have been loaded.

2005-07-26  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-settings.c (hildon_file_system_settings_setup_dbus): changed pending dbus calls to use default timeout value (which is longer than our old value).

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model.c : 
	  - Fixed a race condition from volumes-changed handler
	    (not queued to idle anymore).
	  - Restored call to delayed_add_children that was removed earlier.
            Added one new call to this function to set_mmc_state as well
	    (to make mmc immediately show '+' sign if needed).
