	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-settings.c (hildon_file_system_settings_setup_dbus): changed pending dbus calls to use default timeout value (which is longer than our old value).

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model.c : 
	  - Fixed a race condition from volumes-changed handler
	    (not queued to idle anymore).
	  - Restored call to delayed_add_children that was removed earlier.
            Added one new call to this function to set_mmc_state as well
	    (to make mmc immediately show '+' sign if needed).
