2006-11-22  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@nokia.com>

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-chooser-dialog.c (set_entry): Removed
	debugging output.
	(hildon_file_chooser_dialog_select_path): Update name entry widget
	as required by GtkFileChooser behavior. (M469)

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-selection.c
	(hildon_file_selection_select_unselect_main_iter): Get path from
	sort model, not from filter model since the view shows the sort
	model.

        From José Dapena Paz <jdapena@igalia.com>.  Thanks! (M842)
	
 	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-chooser.c: Add available filters to pane
	context menu. The filters are added with method add_filter (and
	removed with remove_filter). Only filters with name are shown, and
	that name is the one used in the context menu.

2006-11-21  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@nokia.com>

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-upnp.c
	(hildon_file_system_upnp_create_child_location): Use
	qgn_list_filesys_mediaserver icon instead of
	qgn_list_filesys_divc_cls. (N45114)

        From Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>.  Thanks!
   
 	* configure.ac: Add a check for perl and and a --disable-rebuilds
	option, to control whether the hildon-fm-enums-types.[h|c] will be
	built.  This matches the same build files stuff in hildon-libs.

 	* hildon-fm/Makefile.am: Generate hildon-fm-enums-types.[h|c],
	containing GType declarations for hildon-fm enums, so we can use
	them, for instance, in GValues, and so that enum properties can be
	declared properly, instead of using ints.

2006-11-17  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@nokia.com>

	Released 2.0
	
	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-obex.c
	(_obex_addr_to_display_name): Do not call
	dbus_connection_disconnect.

	(navigation_pane_tap_and_hold_query): Use
	signal_navigation_pane_context_menu instead of
	signal_content_pane_context_menu, stupid.

2006-09-07  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@nokia.com>

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-selection.c (tap_and_hold_query,

	animation when no handlers are connected.
	(hildon_file_selection_create_thumbnail_view,

	Released 1.8.
	
	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-settings.c (BANNER_TIMEOUT):
	Reduced to 500 ms so that it is smaller than the initial delay of
	showing the banner.  There needs to be more theory for determining
	the 'right' timeout.
	(banner_pid): New, to store a permanent pid in the face of Linux'
	per-thread-pids.
	(_hildon_file_system_prepare_banner): Initialize it when needed

2006-09-05  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@nokia.com>

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model.c (node_needs_reload): New,
	factored out of hildon_file_system_model_delayed_add_children.
	(hildon_file_system_model_delayed_add_children): Use it.  Call
	handle_possibly_finished_node when the reload request is ignored
	so that the "finished-loading" signal is emitted for every node
	that enters the reload queue. (N31278, N38652)
	(_hildon_file_system_model_queue_reload): Use it to reject
	unneeded reloads.

        gtk_tree_view_get_dest_row_at_pos instead of old 
        gtk_tree_view_get_path_at_pos.

        Other changes as well -- check the diff.

2006-02-14  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>

	Moved hildon-file-details-dialog from hildon-libs to hildon-fm.
        Merged hildon-lgpl into hildon-libs.

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model.h: 
	Use a prototype declaration for HildonFileSystemModel, 
	as with other structs, so that the C++ bindings can hide the 
	full implementation from their headers.

2006-01-12  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>

	N#19820 Memory leaks in the file selector dialog and underlying components
	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model.c
	(_HildonFileSystemModelPrivate): added signal_handler_id table
	(hildon_file_system_model_finalize): use _disconnect instead of
	_disconnect_by_func, which does not release memory early enough.

	N#20341 hildon_file_system_model_autoname_uri doesn't work
	        properly for names having numbers.

	* hildon-file-system-private.[ch]:
	(_hildon_file_system_parse_autonumber): Moved parse_autonumber
	here from hildon-file-system-model.c, with following changes:
	Changed all error cases immediately return -1 (not accepted) and
	remove separate ACCEPT state (input is now accepted, when state
	machine is in CLOSE state at the end of input). Small logic
	changes (not increase input pointer after number conversion, since
	it already points to next character).
	
	(_hildon_file_system_remove_autonumber): Refactored from
	autoname_uri. Also needed in save dialog.
	
	* hildon-file-system-model.c: move out parse_autonumber(). Use new
	_hildon_file_system_parse_autonumber instead.

	* hildon-file-chooser-dialog.c
	(hildon_file_chooser_dialog_set_current_name): Changed to remove
	existing autonumber from name, if autonumbering is enabled.

        N#19698 File dialog doesn't free everything it has allocated/cached
	
	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-private.c: Changed the cache to use
	weak references instead of normal hard references. Chnaged the
	whole cache object to be destroyed as well, when it temporarily
	becomes empty.
	
	(load_icon_cached): Reference changes due to above logic change.
	(insert_icon): Added weak reference.
	(get_cache): Changed to use new finalizer function.
	(icon_finalized): New function, called when a cached icon is freed.
	(cache_finalize): New function, called when the whole cache
	becomes empty or icon theme dies.

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model: Changed to keep hard
	reference to emblems, because cache modifications would otherwise
	cause emblems to be reloaded for each composite icon made.

	(finalize): Unref emblems
	(create_composite_image): Changed to take emblem icon as
	parameter, not just name.
	(get_collapsed_emblem): New function, ensures that emblem is
	cached
	(get_expanded_emblem): New function, ensures that emblem is cached

        - removed automatical name entry selection after model has
          finished loading.
        - autonaming now selects the generated file name only if the user
          hasn't moved the cursor yet; otherwise the new cursor location
          is preserved.
          N#19311

2005-09-26  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>

	* configure.ac: 0.9.42

	hildon_file_selection_model_delayed_add_node_list_timeout idle
	handler priority lowered

	constructed breadth-first, not depth-first
	(_hildon_file_system_model_prioritize_folder): function added for
	moving a folder to the head of delayed_lists queue
	
	* hildon-fm/hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model.h: added prototype
	for _hildon_file_system_model_prioritize_folder

	* hildon-fm/hildon-fm/hildon-file-selection.c
	(hildon_file_selection_selection_changed): now calls
	_hildon_file_system_model_prioritize_folder when the folder is

	* configure.ac: 0.9.41

2005-09-15  Kristian Rietveld  <kris@imendio.com>

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model.c
	(hildon_file_system_model_kick_node): first emit the row_deleted
	signal, than actually delete the node from the tree. (the
	row_deleted signal can trigger unrefs for this node, which still
	need to be handled). N#17314

2005-09-14  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-private.c

	N#14586 Gateway content needs update if
	   1) user clicks on a folder AND more than 30s is passed from
	   last reload.
	   2) User activates a filewithin current folder and than 30s is
	   passed from last reload.
	
	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-selection.c
	(hildon_file_selection_selection_changed): reload gateway content.

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model.c
	(_hildon_file_system_model_queue_reload): likewise.


2005-09-08  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>

	* configure.ac: Release 0.9.38
	
2005-09-09  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>

	N#16092 Filetree doesn't use singleton mime-type icons, but keeps
	multiple copies of them in memory.
	
	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-private.[ch]
	(_hildon_file_system_load_icon_cached): New function that
	implements caching.

2005-09-08  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>

	* configure.ac: Release 0.9.37

2005-09-07  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>

	Some GTK filesystem backend cause blocking for unknown amount of
	time. We "solve" this (give feedback to the user) by adding a dbus
	service to TN to display an "updating" info banner after one
	second.
	
	* hildon-file-system-settings.h: Introduced new internal API to
	communicate with task navigator in order to display banner during
	blocking backend operations.

	* hildon-file-system-settings.c: Implemented new communication API.

	* hildon-file-system-model.c:
	- Added calls to task navigator to show banner during blocking
	calls.
	
	- Changed nodes that need to be reloaded to be queued instead of
	the old approach where error nodes were queued. In this way we can
	remove problem nodes from model immediately after error condition
	is detected.
	
2005-09-07  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>
	
	* hildon-file-system-model.c: Added handler for new
	GtkFileSystemError code. This causes less calls over bluetooth.	

2005-08-30  Tommi Komulainen  <tommi.komulainen@nokia.com>

	* configure.ac: Release 0.9.36

2005-08-30  Tommi Komulainen  <tommi.komulainen@nokia.com>

	track most frequently used nodes and remove oldest items if needed, to
	limit memory consumption.
	N#16151

2005-08-22  Tommi Komulainen  <tommi.komulainen@nokia.com>

	* configure.ac: Release 0.9.35

2005-08-22  Tommi Komulainen  <tommi.komulainen@nokia.com>

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model.c: (get_value) In some cases
	gateway folder became dimmed because of read error. 
	* (handle_delayed_error) It was possible that the whole gateway root
	folder got deleted.
	* (delayed_add_children) gtk_file_system_folder_list_children
	succeeds, even in a case bt is switched off. Made a workaround for
	this.
	* Some code cleanup (handle_delayed_error, set_mmc_state,
	flightmode_changed).
	* Added implementation for the new signal and protection mechanism to
	avoid several reloads from gateway when there is no connection.

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model.h: Added new
	"device-disconnected" signal.

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-selection.c: Added handler for the new signal.
	* (selection_changed) We now return current folder back to it's
	previous place if we fail to connect to gateway device.
	* changed "to_be_selected" row reference into "current_folder", which
	keeps eye on current folder all the time. This change was needed to
	know previous folder. This causes many small changes here and there.

	N#14585, N#14586

2005-08-17  Tommi Komulainen  <tommi.komulainen@nokia.com>

	* configure.ac: Release 0.9.34

	also active/passive focus.

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model.c
	(hildon_file_system_model_add_node): Block file system backend from
	sending a signal just when the same node is being added to internal
	data model, which causes that the internal data model believes that it
	has already loaded the folder.
	N#14040

2005-08-16  Tommi Komulainen  <tommi.komulainen@nokia.com>

	Update to new l10n packaging style.  po-files (inside this package)
	are not used for now, the message catalogs come from separate packages
	and including them here would conflict.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): stop including po-files
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST):
	* debian/hildon-fm-l10n-engb.install:
	* debian/hildon-fm-l10n-src.install:

2005-08-09  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model.c: Now MMC state is
	investigated immediately when the widget is created. It makes the
	creation to take a bit more time, but ensures that MMC locations
	are usable as well right from the start.

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-chooser-dialog.c: Allow setting limit to
	the filename. Added two new properties:

	- "max-full-path-length": Works as current limitation system, but
	you can now change the value as well (if needed, defaults to 255)

	- "max-name-length": Limits the length of individual file/folder
	name as entered by user (note that possible hidden
	extension/folder path make the name longer).

2005-08-03  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-chooser-dialog.c
	(hildon_file_chooser_dialog_get_paths): remove leading dots from
	user provided file names (otherwise files are be hidden by the
	filemanager, and the user has no way to access them.)

2005-08-01  Luc Pionchon  <luc.pionchon@nokia.com>

	* hildon-file-selection.c: GtkTreeModelSort didn't keep
	the order very well for equal nodes, therefore a sort 
	function was fixed to handle device nodes correctly.
	
	* hildon-file-system-model.c: Now allowing load_uri to access
	gateway before gateway is accessed by UI.

	* hildon-file-system-settings.[ch]: Added
	_hildon_file_system_settings_ready() for checking if all settings
	have been loaded.

	* hildon-fm/hildon-file-system-model.c : 
	  - Fixed a race condition from volumes-changed handler
	    (not queued to idle anymore).
	  - Restored call to delayed_add_children that was removed earlier.
            Added one new call to this function to set_mmc_state as well
	    (to make mmc immediately show '+' sign if needed).

	Fixed notes files not opened after duplicating

	Fixed 'autoname_uri' that didn't work properly for files with double
	extensions

	Fixed Control Panel that crashed on exporting certificate to MMC & the
	MMC cover is open

	Fixed HildonFileChooserDialog that didn't implement
