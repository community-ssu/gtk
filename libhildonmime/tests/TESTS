Tests to carry out and expected results:
========================================

For these tests, you will need to set up your environment first.
If running in scratchbox, you need to make sure your DBus session is running:
	
	$ export DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:2
	$ af-sb-init.sh start

Then 

	$ source /etc/osso-af-init/af-defines.sh

When this is done, you will need to make sure your environment points to the test data:

	$ export XDG_DATA_HOME="/home/martyn/Source/libhildonmime/tests/datadir-local"	
	$ export XDG_DATA_DIRS="/home/martyn/Source/libhildonmime/tests/datadir"

For the test-all test, this is set up automatically, for all others, you will need this.
