MIME/DBus Service Mapping
=========================

Preamble
========

Before reading this, you should make sure you are full aqainted with
the desktop entry standard which libhildonmime builds on top of. This
can be found here:

  http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/

Also, this document assumes familiarity with adding MIME types to the
system, using the shared-mime-info specification. This specification
can be found at:

  http://standards.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/latest/


Commands
========

There are 2 different utilities used when it comes to the MIME
database/desktop files:

  * update-desktop-database:
  * update-mime-datebase:


Updating the Desktop Database
=============================

The 'update-desktop-database' command looks at *.desktop file anywhere below:

  $prefix/share/applications/

and from those files generates cache files, which are used when
looking up which application to open a certain MIME type with, in
order to not having to go through all the desktop files when doing
that.

Like update-mime-database, this is usually done in the post-inst phase
in a Debian package, in addition to "make install" in the makefile
target:

  update-desktop-database $prefix/share/applications
