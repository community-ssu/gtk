MIME/Category Mapping
=====================

Note: This document assumes familiarity with adding MIME types to the
system, using the shared-mime-info specification. The specification can
be found at:

  http://standards.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/shared-mime-info-spec-0.13.html


The platform has a notion of file categories for the user's data
files. The available categories are:

 * Bookmarks 	
 * Contacts 	
 * Documents 	
 * Emails 	
 * Images 	
 * Audio 	
 * Video 	
 * Other

A mapping is setup between categories and MIME types, so that the MIME
type of a file decides which category it is in. The MIME type setup is
handled by the shared-mime-info infrastructure, and the category
information is added to that same framework.

There is also a category API in libossomime that is used to get the
category of a certain MIME type and a list of MIME types in a certain
category.

See the API documentation for libossomime for more details on this.


Adding mappings
---------------

Adding a mapping between a category and a number of MIME types is done
much like adding or editing the supported MIME types in the system.

Each application or library that adds a category mapping should add a
file in:

  /usr/share/mime/packages/

The file format is the same XML format used for MIME types, with an
added tag "<osso:category>". An example follows:


  <mime-info xmlns="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info"
             xmlns:osso="http://nokia.com/osso/mime-categories">

    <mime-type type="application/pdf">
      <osso:category name="documents"/>
    </mime-type>

    <mime-type type="image/jpeg">
      <osso:category name="images"/>
    </mime-type>

    <mime-type type="image/png">
      <osso:category name="images"/>
    </mime-type>

  </mime-info>


The example sets up three mappings, between PDF files and the Document
category, and between JPEG and PNG images and the Images category.

The valid category names are:

  audio, bookmarks, contacts, documents, emails, images, video

MIME types that does not have a category set up automatically are
treated as members in the category Other.

If the application also adds the MIME type in question, the MIME
information and category information can be put in the same file:


    <mime-type type="image/png">
      <comment>PNG image</comment>
      <magic priority="50">
        <match value="\x89PNG" type="string" offset="0"/>
      </magic>
      <glob pattern="*.png"/>
      <osso:category name="images"/>
    </mime-type>


As when adding MIME types, a special program needs to be run to update
the MIME information:

  osso-update-category-database /usr/share/mime

Like update-mime-database, this is usually done in the post-inst phase
in a Debian package, in addition to "make install" in the makefile
target.
