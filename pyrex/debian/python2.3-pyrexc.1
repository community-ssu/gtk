.SH NAME
pyrexc \- compile python-like .pyx file to C for use as python module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pyrexc
.RI " files" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B pyrexc
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBpyrexc\fP is a python script that converts a .pyx file to C, so it can
be compiled for use as a Python module.
.PP
You then need to compile the .c file along with the include files for
Python, and link it into a shared library.
.PP
The HTML documentation explains this better, and the Demo examples show how
to automate the compile and link stages more easily.
