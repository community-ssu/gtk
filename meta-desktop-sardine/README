meta-desktop-sardine
--------------------

This is just an 'empty' meta package that contains the sardine desktop
configuration. It has the proper dependencies and switches to plankton as the
'default' theme during installaion. It ensures the right icons/themes are
being pulled.

Similiar packages should be created for other desktop product configurations.
