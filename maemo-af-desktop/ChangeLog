        * Applied patch which fixes bug "saved sketch.png picture can not be selected as background image".
        * Cleaned up the code a bit after applying the patch - there was duplicate include for
          log-functions.h (the one I had added and the one this patch added). The other one of them was removed.
        * There is now additional line gtk_file_filter_add_pattern (mime_type_filter, "*.png"); after
          the gtk_file_filter_add_mime_type statements.
