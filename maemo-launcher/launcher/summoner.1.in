.SH NAME
maemo\-summoner \- summon a program from command line
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B maemo\-summoner
.RI [ options "] " file " [" file-options... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmaemo\-summoner\fP directly loads an application in the same way that
the \fBmaemo\-launcher\fP would do, making easier the debugging tasks.
It will summon the file provided on the command line with its optional
arguments, otherwise it will summon its own program name with the string
\fI.launch\fP appended and will pass the arguments as well.
So it can be symlinked in place of the real \fIapplication\fP, and this
one moved to \fIapplication.launch\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.

.B \-\-help
