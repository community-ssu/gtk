.SH NAME
maemo\-invoker \- invoke a program from the launcher
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B maemo\-invoker
.RI [ options "] " file " [" file-options... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmaemo\-invoker\fP tells maemo-launcher what application to start.
It will invoke the file provided on the command line with its optional
arguments, otherwise it will invoke its own program name with the string
\fI.launch\fP appended and will pass the arguments as well.
So it can be symlinked in place of the real \fIapplication\fP, and this
one moved to \fIapplication.launch\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-\-delay SECS
After invoking the program sleep for SECS seconds before exiting. If SECS is
0 maemo\-invoker will wait until the program finishes, returning its exit
status. The default behaviour is to wait for the invoked program to exit.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show version of program.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B MAEMO_INVOKER_DELAY
Set the exit delay. The command line option overrides this.
