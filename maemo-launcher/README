What is the maemo-launcher?
===========================

The maemo-launcher is a daemon to speedup applications startup time.

It opens a new GdkDisplay, makes it the default and forces all gtkrc files
to be parsed and initializes some other components like pango, stores the
GtkSettings object that was associated with the display's default screen
(this is a hack, the settings and all cached gtkrc stuff should be deleted
if display/screen closing was implemented correctly, but they aren't because
display/screen closing is not supported at the moment), then it closes the
GdkDisplay.

When an application is invoked it forks, tries to restore the environment as
if it had been started directy, dynamically opens the application, opens a
new display and associates its screen with the stored state (the GtkSettings;
this is the second hack which only works because we *know* the new display's
properties are identical to the old display's ones). And afterwards launches
the application by calling the "main" function.

The launcher is listening to a unix socket for notifications of new
applications to be launched. The maemo-invoker is the program in charge to
notify the launcher of which application to run.

Read the man pages for further information.


Current known issues
====================

The maemo-invoker does not return the exit value of the launched program.

If the application takes too much time to register the DBUS service the
maemo-invoker may have exited already, so dbus will not allow the application
to register it after the process it has started has finished already.

Binaries intended to be run by maemo-launcher must be linked with the
"-pie -rdynamic" linker flags if they should transparently work as
executables and dlopen()-able objects. If running them as executable is not
a requirement, "-rdynamic" or "-shared" is good enough.

Transferring the GtkSettings to the child's screen is a hack, therefore it
will only work if we open the "same" display again (the same display on the
same server with the same visuals and colormaps).

gnome_vfs_init() cannot be called by the daemon because it opens a pipe to
the vfs daemon.

Children using GThread should use

  if (!g_thread_supported())
    g_thread_init(NULL);

to be safe against possible future changes in maemo-launcher.

Until display/screen closing is fully supported, we should not do anything
with the original display, esp. not opening windows on it.

The children are dlopen()ed using RTLD_LAZY, so symbol relocation errors are
not caught at the time we call dlopen(). Instead, the child will crash
randomly at any later point if the libraries it depends on are somehow messed.


Integrating the maemo-launcher painlessly
=========================================

These are the detailed changes needed to add support for the new
maemo-launcher. The launcher will not be used by default, so once it's
checked that it works with the specific application it can be enabled
explicitely.

The changes are meant for normal OSSO packages using automake. If yours
differ feel free to contact me (Guillem Jover <guillem.jover@nokia.com>)
and I can help you on the process.


Upstream Changes
----------------

On the Makefile.am that is creating the final application binary, add to
the application_CFLAGS variable:

	$(MAEMO_LAUNCHER_CFLAGS)

And to the the application_LDFLAGS variable:

	$(MAEMO_LAUNCHER_LDFLAGS)


Debian Changes
--------------

* debian/control:

 - Add a "${launcher:Depends} to the "Depends:" line of the package
   containing the application to be launched.

* debian/rules:

 - Initializing the launcher variables:

---X<---
LAUNCHER = no

ifneq (,$(findstring maemo-launcher,$(DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS)))
	LAUNCHER = yes
endif

ifeq "$(strip $(LAUNCHER))" "yes"
	LAUNCHER_DEPENDS = -Vlauncher:Depends="maemo-launcher"
	LAUNCHER_CFLAGS = -shared
	LAUNCHER_LDFLAGS = -shared -export-dynamic
endif
---X<---

 - On the make target reponsible of the building (usually "build:"),
   pass the following variables to the make call:

---X<---
	$(MAKE) \
	  MAEMO_LAUNCHER_CFLAGS="$(LAUNCHER_CFLAGS)" \
	  MAEMO_LAUNCHER_LDFLAGS="$(LAUNCHER_LDFLAGS)" \
	  ...
---X<---

 - On the "install:" target after having installed the binaries
   (usually after "$(MAKE) install ...") do:

---X<---
ifeq "$(strip $(LAUNCHER))" "yes"
	mv $(CURDIR)/debian/application-package/usr/bin/application \
	   $(CURDIR)/debian/application-package/usr/bin/application.launch
	ln -s /usr/bin/maemo-invoker \
	      $(CURDIR)/debian/application-package/usr/bin/application
endif
---X<---

   Substitute application with the name of the application to be launched,
   and application-package with the package containing such application.

 - On the "binary:" target, change:

	dh_gencontrol

   to

	dh_gencontrol -- $(LAUNCHER_DEPENDS)


Activating the maemo-launcher in the application
================================================


Testing the launcher enabled application
----------------------------------------

To test if your application just works with the launcher, build with the
following command line:

	DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=maemo-launcher dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc

Install the package, and start the application from the Task Navigator.
Check as much as possible for extraneous behaviour.

WARNING: The launcher requires a modified libgdk, if it's not present
the launcher itself will segfault. That version is present on w2005-24
release.


Enabling the launcher after checking that it works
--------------------------------------------------

If the tests were successful, you just have to change the first LAUNCHER
variable assignment from "no" to "yes":

---X<---
LAUNCHER = yes
---X<---

If for any reason the launcher stops working, or it's found that it's
breaking some part of the application (although in general the launcher
is not at fault, and only triggers unrelated bugs in other components)
you can disable it by setting the variable back to "no".
