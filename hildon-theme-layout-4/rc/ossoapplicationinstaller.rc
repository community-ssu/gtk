# The Application installer main view background image
# 
# The image will not be tiled if it doesn't cover the whole window;
# it will be placed in the lower right corner.
# 
# Because this behavior is not directly supported by the theming
# machinery, the Application installer renders the background image
# itself.  What pixmap to render is specified here, but in a hackish
# way: the render code in the Application installer will look into
# bg_pixmap[ACTIVE] to find the pixmap, and will render it always,
# independent of the state of the widget.
# 
# A proper solution would be to have symbolic image filenames.
