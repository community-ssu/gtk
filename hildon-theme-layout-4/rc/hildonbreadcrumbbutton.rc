# HILDON BREAD CRUMB BUTTON
#
# Copyright 2006 Nokia Oyj
#
# This file has the themeing of toolbar's menu
# button.
#
# The choicelist version of combobox which only
# allows selection, not edition is named GtkComboBox
# and is actually just one big GtkButton that has text
# inside it. Therefore one image per state is enough
# for it.
#
# The combobox version that allows editing of the text
# is named GtkComboBoxEntry and consists of two parts:
# A GtkButton and GtkEntry. These have to be themed
# separately.
#
# Additionally, when a combobox is in a toolbar,
# it will use different graphics that show the arrow
# pointing upwards.
