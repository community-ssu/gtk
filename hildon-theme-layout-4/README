Versioning (x.y.z)
------------------

The relation between the themes and layouts is a static one, not dynamic (think:
statically linked libraries). Therefore it's important to stick to a package
versioning system so that the layout version can be discovered from the theme
version itself. 

The following basic rules apply to this layout package:

1) y is increased each time the layout itself (cutting information) is changed.
2) z is increased each time the rc data was modified

Generally the themes have (should have) a dependency bound to the 'y' version of the 
package. So, for example, a theme might depend on a layout > 1.4.x but < 1.5.x. So,
increasing the y version of the layout WILL BREAK ALL THEMES BASED ON THIS
LAYOUT (till they're fixed and the dependency is readjusted again). 

This is intentional. It's meant to prevent the rebuild of the broken theme. y
shoulbe be changed each time the changes in the layout will render the children
themes broken -- ie. changing the cutting information will render the themes
broken as they have no proper graphics in the proper places. 

Additionally, the platform version (or -- the major API version) is embedded in
the name of the layout package. For example:

        hildon-theme-layout-2 for mistral
        hildon-theme-layout-3 for bora
        ...

It's handled in such a way since the user might want to have severall layouts
(layout versions) installed at the same time. 

The themes take this major API number as they major version number. For example:

        hildon-theme-plankton 4.x.y is a theme based on hildon-theme-layout-4
        hildon-theme-plankton 3.x.y is a theme based on hildon-theme-layout-3
        ...
