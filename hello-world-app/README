This is hello-world-app, an example package for the Application
installer.

You can build it like any other Debian package:

    $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

The result is a .deb package that can be installed by the Application
installer, and by the Application installer alone.

When it is installed, it will add these items to the system:

  - An application in the "Extra" menu of the Task navigator
    that is also a DBUS service.

  - A Control panel applet.

  - A Statusbar plugin.

  - A Home applet.

  - A shared library, used by all of the components above.

  - Some icons for the hicolor theme, also used by the components above.

To see the Statusbar and Home plugins, you might need to restart the
Desktop, for example by rebooting.
