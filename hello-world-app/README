HOW-TO-USE
each script (sb-wizard, sb-wizard) takes the following argument

$1 = package-name e.g sample-statusbar-plugin
$2 = package description
$3 = library name e.g sample_status_bar [results in libsample_status_bar]
$4 = name of the icon file e.g sample_icon [note , no extension]

GENERATE YOUR SAMPLE PROJECT

CONTROL PANEL
./cp-wizard $1 $2 $3 $4

STATUS BAR
./sb-wizard $1 $2 $3 $4

cd into the generated directory and then issue
./autogen.sh
./configure
fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage

Now once everything builds, start writing your own GUI and logic :)
