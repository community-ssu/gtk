"B<dpkg-scanpackages> sorts through a tree of Debian binary packages and "
"creates a Packages file, used by B<apt>(8), B<dselect>(1), etc, to tell the "
"user what packages are available for installation. These Packages files are "
"the same as those found on Debian archive sites and CD-ROMs. You might use "
"B<dpkg-scanpackages> yourself if making a directory of local packages to "
"install on a cluster of machines."
