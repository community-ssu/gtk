"It is possible for several programs fulfilling the same or similar functions "
"to be installed on a single system at the same time.  For example, many "
"systems have several text editors installed at once.  This gives choice to "
"the users of a system, allowing each to use a different editor, if desired, "
"but makes it difficult for a program to make a good choice for an editor to "
"invoke if the user has not specified a particular preference."

"Debian's alternatives system aims to solve this problem.  A generic name in "
"the filesystem is shared by all files providing interchangeable "
"functionality.  The alternatives system and the system administrator "
"together determine which actual file is referenced by this generic name.  "
"For example, if the text editors B<ed>(1)  and B<nvi>(1)  are both installed "
"on the system, the alternatives system will cause the generic name "
"I</usr/bin/editor> to refer to I</usr/bin/nvi> by default. The system "
"administrator can override this and cause it to refer to I</usr/bin/ed> "
"instead, and the alternatives system will not alter this setting until "
"explicitly requested to do so."

"The generic name is not a direct symbolic link to the selected alternative.  "
"Instead, it is a symbolic link to a name in the I<alternatives> "
"I<directory>, which in turn is a symbolic link to the actual file "
