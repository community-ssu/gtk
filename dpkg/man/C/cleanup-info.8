.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cleanup\-info
is a Perl script that tries to clean up the mess that bogus
.BR install\-info (8)
may have done.
It gathers all sections with the same heading into a single one.
It tries to be smart about cases and trailing colon/spaces.
.br
Other clean-ups include removing of empty sections, and squeezing the blank
lines (in entries part only).
.sp
Order of sections is preserved (the first encountered section counts).
Order of entries within a section is preserved.
.sp
Please be \fBextremely careful\fP when using this utility - it might
not be 100% safe. cleanup\-info tries to be careful with your info dir
file, but only until it writes it. You should back the file up prior
to using this script.
