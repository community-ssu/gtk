# This file contains the list of architecture names in Debian's ‘sid’
# distribution.
#
# Architecture names are formed as a combination of the system name
# (from ostable) and CPU name (from cputable).  Support for new
# architectures in dpkg is added in those files, architecture names
# are only added to this file when added to the distribution.
#
# Column 1 is present for historical reasons only, and should be ignored.
# Column 2 contains the Debian name for the architecture, which is returned
# by ‘dpkg --print-architecture’.
#
