To make management of bugs against the dpkg suite easier we add as many of
the following “pseudo-tags” to the start of the subject (title) as apply
to the bug.

When filing bugs, please do the same to aid triage.

[ASSERT]		Errors caused by assert().
[SEGFAULT]		Errors that cause segmentation faults.
[CONFFILE]		Issues with configuration file handling.
[DEPENDS]		Issues with dependency relationship handling.
[TRIVIAL]		Bug should be trivial to fix.
[PERF]			Performance problems.
[DOC]			Documentation bugs, including --help and manpages.
[UTF-8]			Conversion to the UTF-8 encoding.
[ARCH]			Updates to ‘cputable’, ‘ostable’ and porting patches.
			Include the dpkg architecture name in the tag,
			e.g. [ARCH:sparc]
[INTL]			New or updated translations and bugs affecting
			translation.  Include the language code in the tag,
			e.g. [INTL:cy_GB]
