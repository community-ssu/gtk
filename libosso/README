Welcome to the wonderful world of Libosso!

Frequently asked questions (FAQ):

1. What is Libosso?

Libosso is a wrapper library for user applications for platform-specific,
frequently-used D-Bus services. Thus, it should not contain anything
that is not platform-specific -- ideally Libosso should not exist.

2. What is the purpose of Libosso?

The purpose of Libosso is to hide ugly D-Bus API details for
frequently-used, platform-specific services. Note that 'frequently
used' here means that they are frequently used in the user application
level (as opposed to daemons and such lower-level programs). If there
would be easy-to-use D-Bus library, even then there is still a purpose
for Libosso: shielding applications from D-Bus API changes. Ideally,
Libosso would completely hide the message bus technology, so that
D-Bus could be even replaced by some other technology.

3. Why don't you use ChangeLog?

Basically because the current maintainer is too lazy to do work that
a machine should do, and a diff of the code is sufficiently simple to
understand even without explanations. The current maintainer thinks that
the code should be self-explanatory -- if it's not, it needs to be
sufficiently commented or even re-designed.

4. What is 'muali'?

Muali comes from words 'Maemo user application library' and it's a
working-name for new, re-designed Libosso API. The API is in early
development phase and will have a commenting round later when there
is something to show.
