libosso (0.9.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * src/osso-application-top.c (utf8_safe): New.
  (_append_environment): Use it to skip over environment variables
  that can not be transmitted as a DBUS_TYPE_STRING.

libosso (0.9.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a memory leak in _get_arg (bug 19148).

libosso (0.9.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a memory leak in osso_rpc_run_* (bug 18083).
  * Marked several private functions as static and set the hidden attribute
    to some functions.
  * Improved error logging in osso_initialize().
  * Now handling EINTR correctly in osso_state_close().
  * Removed rather brain-damaged cleanup of state saving directory from
    osso_initialize(). Its success is not guaranteed and its usefulness is
    basically zero, so it would just add to undeterministic behaviour.
  * Fixed some minor brain-damages in coding style.
  * Added warnings about the activation parameter of osso_initialize().
  * Removed calls to dbus_connection_disconnect() (bug 18028).
  * Using LIBOSSO_DEBUG macro instead of DEBUG macro for internal sanity
    checks etc.
  * Fixed D-BUS message leak from osso_display_* that would have happened
    in error situation.
  * Fixed possible uninitialized memory problem in _osso_hw_state_get().
  * Fixed brain-damage in osso_hw_set_event_cb() that would have caused
    memory leaks with each subsequent call after the first one.
  * Fixed reading the current device state from file - it was completely
    broken (used wrong member of the Libosso context struct).
  * Re-run automake-1.7.
  * Added some files required by automake-1.7.
  * Rewrote most of the code in osso-hw.c.
  * Connected the low memory signal handler to correct D-BUS signal (bug
    18069).
  * Implemented caching for the device mode, since MCE won't provide a file
    with the value. Each user has own cache file due to permission issues.
  * Now calling osso_application_autosave_force automatically when the
    save_unsaved_data signal comes (bug 10960).
  * Replaced most mallocs with callocs.
  * Removed some unnecessary dynamic memory allocations.
  * Fixed two small memory leaks in osso-application-top.c with a new internal
    function.

libosso (0.9.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for environment variable LIBOSSO_CP_PLUGIN_DIRS to

    state_data (bug 17743).

libosso (0.9.10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some cleanups before publishing.
  * Checked through all the function comments in libosso.h and rephrased

    example code.
