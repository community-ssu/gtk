GnomeVFS has a few limitations:

* It may not work correctly across forks. For a bit more information see:
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=81076

* The current ssh module won't work if you don't have an ssh-agent set up to
  allow you to log in without supplying a password.

* The current ssh module won't work correctly if your shell on the remote
  system is not bash. A real bourne shell or zsh may also work but have not
  been tested. Tcsh is known to not work.
