This version of GnomeVFS is based on upstream GnomeVFS 2.8.x with added
support for using DBUS for communicating with the daemon.

See doc/dbus-protocol.txt for a description of the protocol used.

The port is a straight forward port of the CORBA based version to keep
the patch as small as possible.

NOTE: This version is patched with some Nokia-specific additions such as
adding volume monitoring for OBEX devices.
