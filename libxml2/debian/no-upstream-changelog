The full upstream changelog is available in the file
/usr/share/doc/libxml2/changelog.gz in the package libxml2.

It has been removed from the documentation package (i.e. libxml2-doc) to
avoid duplication of its huge data in the debian archive, while it is
still available in an other package.

It could have been symlinked, like in the others packages such as
libxml2-utils, but it would have required a dependency upon libxml2,
which was not wanted.
