Title: GTK+2.0 Tutorial
Author: Tony Gale and Ian Main
Abstract: GTK (GIMP Toolkit) is a library for creating graphical user
 interfaces. It is licensed using the LGPL license, so you can develop
 open software, free software, or even commercial non-free software
 using GTK without having to spend anything for licenses or royalties.

 This tutorial is an attempt to document as much as possible of GTK,
 but it is by no means complete. This tutorial assumes a good
 understanding of C, and how to create C programs. It would be a great
 benefit for the reader to have previous X programming experience, but
 it shouldn't be necessary.
