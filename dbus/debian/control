Description: simple interprocess messaging system
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between
 applications.  Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets
 and CORBA in terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more.  It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML.  D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 D-Bus is still under heavy development, but is expected to be widely
 used.  It comes with several interfaces, including GLib.  See the
 description of dbus-glib-1 for more information about those.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon; the client-side library can
 be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no longer contained in
 this package.
