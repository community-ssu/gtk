gtk-engines
===========

This package provides three sample theme engines for GTK+:

 Pixmap: A generic engine that renders using pixmaps.
   One theme using this theme engine is included.

 Metal: A fairly complete theme engine that looks like the
   Java-Metal look of Swing.

 Redmond95: A simple theme engine that looks a bit like 
   Microsoft Windows 95.

Requirements
============

To compile this package, you must have:

 GTK+, version 1.3.12 or better

   http://www.gtk.org/
   ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/

Installation
============

 ./configure 
 make
 [ become root ]
 make install


If you configured GTK+ in a non-default prefix, you should
configure this package the same way. For instance:

 ./configure --prefix=/opt/gtk+

If you need to install this package in a different prefix
from GTK+, then you'll have to set your GTK_PATH environment
variable to point to the installed prefix. For instance,
if this package was configured with:

 ./configure --prefix=/home/john.doe/gtk-engines/

Then you'd set:

 GTK_PATH=/home/john.doe/gtk-engines/lib/gtk-2.0/
 export GTK_PATH

This will allow GTK+ to find the newly installed theme
engines. To use the sample themes (installed into 
$prefix/share/themes), you'll need to copy copy or link them 
into your  ~/.theme directory.

Further Information
===================

Questions about this package should be directed to the
GTK+ mailing lists. See:
