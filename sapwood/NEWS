sapwood 2.91.5 - 2007-06-08
===========================

Changes
-------
Fix 'position' handling to correctly check which widgets are visible.

Improve handling cursor separately from selection.


sapwood 2.91.4 - 2007-04-19
===========================

Changes
-------
Made the 'position' keyword support more generic. Now it can be used for
widgets whose parent has the 'maemo-position-theming' style property set
(only available in maemo modified gtk.)

Don't require gtk+ 2.10 for building.


sapwood 2.91.3 - 2007-03-29
===========================

Changes
-------
Documentation for theme maintainers.

Implement GtkMenuItem active/passive focus.

Special case GtkCheckButton and GtkRadioButton background drawing when focused.


sapwood 2.91.2 - 2007-02-06
===========================

Changes
-------
Fix another case of menu flickering, this time with scroll arrows.

Implement gtk_paint_expander reusing existing theming rules for arrows.


sapwood 2.91.1 - 2007-01-29
===========================

Changes
-------
Fix menu flickering with gtk+ 2.10.

Implement special handling for active/passive focus in treeview.

Add simple wildcard matching for the 'detail' parameter to simplify treeview
row ending details theming.


sapwood 2.91.0 - 2007-01-25
===========================

Bugs fixed
----------
MB#856 - Sapwood crashes with color depth != 16


Changes
-------
Introduce new 'position' keyword for applying different graphics depending on
widget position in the container. Currently it can be used only for buttons in
buttonboxes. This allows theming buttons in dialogs nicely rounded (demo
included.)

Only symbols needed for the theme engine ABI is exported. (make check)

Code cleanups (unused parameters, deprecated functions, ...)
