sapwood 2.14 - 2006-04-03
=========================

Changes
-------
Introduce new 'shaped' gtkrc keyword to explicitly enable support for shaped
windows to improve performance of non-shaped windows. Themes wanting shaped
windows must include 'shaped = TRUE' in gtkrc (and the file must also have
alpha channel.)


sapwood 1.36 - 2005-09-02
=========================

Bugs fixed
----------
#16158 - Most of memory used by g_strdup calls in applications come from the
         sapwood theme engine
  

Changes
-------
Reduce memory consumption by packing structures as bitfields and using
canonicalized string for the image filenames directory component.  With the
current themes this saves around 30k per process.


sapwood 1.22 - 2005-05-27
=========================

Bugs fixed
----------
#9727 - Notebook widget: the most right tab's right border is not displayed


Changes
-------
Increase alpha of the background colored pixels used when dimming icons to
avoid extreme contrast.
