This is a https method for apt that uses libcst for certificate
related things.

Because of license issues, a program can unfortunately not link both
to libapt-pkg (GPL) and OpenSSL (GPL incompatible).  Thus, the "https"
program is written in such a way that it can use the "curl" program
for downloading, or any program that is sufficiently compatible with
it.  We provide such a sufficiently compatible program,
"maemo-mini-curl", that uses libcurl and libcst and also interacts
with the user in the appropriate maemo way.

By default, "https" uses "maemo-mini-curl" but can fall back to
"curl". 

maemo-mini-curl interacts correctly with the Certificate manager and
interacts graphically with the user when needed.


Bugs
----

- Catching HTTP error codes.  I think right now, a 404 is not detected
  by maemo-mini-curl, for example, but the error message from the web
  server is saved.
