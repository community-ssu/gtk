/* Bug history
 *
 * 2006-01-07  Jon Hellan  <hellan@acm.org>
 *
 *   Jon opened the following bug report:
 *
 *	_XError from XRenderCompositeText8
 *	https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5528
 *
 * 2006-03-02  Carl Worth  <cworth@cworth.org>
 *
 *   I wrote this test case to demonstrate the bug.
 *
 *   Approach:
 *
 *	Draw 65535 glyphs white-on-white all on top of each other.
 *
 *   Rationale:
 *
 *	The number 65535 comes from the original bug report.
 *
 *	I would use cairo_show_text with a long string of 'x's say,
 *	but then the surface would need to be enormous to contain
 *	them. A smaller surface could be used, but I fear that at some
 *	point the off-surface glyph drawing would be optimized away
 *	and not exercise the bug.
 *
 *	So, to keep the surface size under control, I use
 *	cairo_show_glyphs which allows me to place the glyphs all on
 *	top of each other. But, since cairo doesn't provide any
 *	character-to-glyphs mapping, I can't get a reliable glyph
 *	index (for character 'x' for example). So I just "guess" a
 *	glyph index and use white-on-white drawing to ignore the
 *	result. (I don't care what's drawn---I just want to ensure
 *	that things don't crash.)
 *
 *  Status: I replicated bug. The largest value of NUM_GLYPHS for
 *      which I saw success is 21842.

/* This is the index into the font for what glyph we'll draw. Since we
 * don't guarantee we'll get any particular font, we can't relibably
 * get any particular glyph. But we don't care what we draw anyway,
 * (see discussion of white-on-white drawing above). For what it's
 * worth, this appears to be giving me 'M' with Bitstream Vera
 * Sans Mono. */
