/* Related bug 5177
 *
 * In short:
 *
 * _cairo_atsui_font_text_to_glyph with a zero-sized string crashes.
 *
 * Moreover, the fallback path in cairo_scaled_font_text_to_glyphs()
 * when handling a zero-sized string, allocates a zero-sized glyph array
 * and when NULL is returned by malloc, recognizes that as an out-of-memory
 * error.  The glibc implementation of malloc() does not return NULL from
 * malloc(0), but I don't think it's a safe assumption.
 *
 * By just bailing out on zero-sized text, we fix both issues.
