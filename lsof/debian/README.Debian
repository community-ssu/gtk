lsof for DEBIAN
----------------------

Comments regarding the Package

Compiled with the HASSECURITY option enabled meaning you can only see
open files for your own processes.

This version of the debian package no longer supports 2.0.x kernels
It now uses the /proc filesystem and should work on any kernel 2.2.x 
or 2.4.x
