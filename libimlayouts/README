This is libimlayouts, a library for reading virtual keyboard layouts and generating new layouts.

To read:
read docs/fileformat.html specially in the API section. This is usually not very useful for you,
except you are implementing a new input method which need the layouts.

To generate and use your own layout(s):
0. modify keyboard.xml
1. ./make.sh
2. ./gen_vkb
3. move your .vkb file(s) to /usr/share/keyboards
