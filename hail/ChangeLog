        * Makefile.am, configure.in, hail/hailcolorbutton.c,
          hail/hailcolorselector.c, ut/hailcolorselector_tests.c:
          * Fixed HailColorSelector color conversion function. It was breaking
            unit tests and was functionally broken.
          * Improved documentation of HailColorButton and HailColorSelector.
          * Release 1.2.0
          * Changed the directory sort order. Now it compiles unit tests
            before documentation.

        * configure.in:
          * Release 1.1.6

          (IMP-26) and documentation.
          * Fix HailWeekdayPicker unit test increasing the waittime for
          buttons interaction.
          * Fix HailVolumebar accessibility unit tests increasing the waittime
          for toggle button click.
          * Add orientation state check in HailVolumebar unit test.
          * Review HailGrid unit tests.
          * Add HailFileSelection support for paned mode of
          HildonFileSelection.

            the strings in locale.
          * Added unit test to check behavior of HailRangeEditor when limits
            are forced. It also lets you test atk editting.
          * Small fix in doc of Seekbar accessibility unit tests. It talked
            about HailSeekbar, and it should say GailRange.

2006-05-24 12:28  

        * hail/hailweekdaypicker.c, ut/hailweekdaypicker_tests.c:
          * Improved unit test for HailWeekdayPicker. Now it checks that the

2006-05-19 13:03  

        * hail/hailnumbereditor.c, ut/hailnumbereditor_tests.c:

          * Added updated API documentation for last changes in HailCaption,
            HailFileSelection and HailRangeEditor.
          * Now HailFileSelection handles folder treeview cell "activate" atk
            signal selecting the folder, making it change the directory as
            expected (closes p.m.o #24431).

2005-12-29  

	* Added HailDialog, which overrides the Gail implementation of ATK
	for GtkDialog, in order to be able to reflect the help hint dialogs
	of the window manager used in Hildon. This object accesses the
	XProtocol extension.
	
	* Added Atk support of HildonTimePicker in HailTimePicker. It's a
	complex implementation based on adding better info and
	organization to the accessibility objects of the internal widgets
	(giving them names and so on).
	
	* Added unit tests for time picker and the test dialog, and
        corrected a unit test for HailAppView to be compliant to the new
	changes in Hildon Libs 0.10 series.

2005-12-23  

	* Removed the Gail source code dependency: now it gets the parent
	class size dynamically, and inherits from a known parent class. The
	parent class type is obtained from the atk factory for the parent
	type of the widget, so it should give a better behaviour with gail
	changes and improvements. The attributes for the Hail classes are
	stored in the private section of GType object system. Anyway, now
	it's required to load gail before hail, so you should change the
	GTK_MODULES to do that (for example you can put
        GTK_MODULES=gail:hail:atk-bridge).
	
	* Removed also the hildon-libs dependency. Now the children are
        obtained using gtk_container_forall
	
	* Changes in gtk-doc Makefile.am in order to load correctly the
	parent types.  Now it adds a GTK_MODULES=gail:hail:atk-bridge to the
	gtk-doc scan programs.  It also removes all the references to gail
	source and compilation directory.
	
	* Added implementation of ATK support for HildonFileSelection
	through HailFileSelection

	* Added documentation for HailFileSelection

	* New way in unit tests to verify the class of gail objects, using
	the dynamic class checking system of gtype.

	* Removed a non-existing include.

	* Fixed an small bug in initializing the private area of
	HailFileSelection
	
	* Now HailFileSelection gets the correct tree folder widget (an
	scrolled window).

	* Added id's to sections and chapters in order to get html's with
	significant names we can show links to.

	* Updated documentation to reflect the new way to define hail
        objects (the trick to avoid any source code dependencies).

2005-12-20  

	* Changed the release to 0.1.0

	* Added Atk implementation for HildonWeekdayPicker, in
	HailWeekdayPicker.  It provides access to the internal weekday
	buttons as toggles.
	
	* Added documentation for HailWeekdayPicker
	
	* Added unit tests for HailWeekdayPicker

	* Improvements to the README file, explaining better how to compile
	and use Hail.
	
	* Added support to configure.in to specify where's the hildon libs
	source code, required now to compile.
	
	* Added dependency to hildon libs source code in order to access
	internal attributes of some widgets.
	
	* Improved and updated the build steps section in docbook.
	
	* Added HailVolumeBar, which implements the ATK interfaces for
	showing the internal mute toggle and the volume range
	
	* Added API documentation for HailVolumeBar
	
	* Added the function button_waiter to unit tests file, which let you
	wait for a button to handle a click
	
	* Added unit tests for HailVolumeBar
	
2005-12-16  

	* Added implementation of ATK for HildonFindToolbar through
	HailFindToolbar

	HailAppView is a string as required.
	
	* Added unit tests for HailFindToolbar

2005-12-15  

	* Corrected documentation of HailAppView. Now it explains
	HailAppView instead of HailCaption.
	
	* Added better descriptions in documentation of HailAppView and
	HailCaption enumerating the new features exposed.
	
	* Removed specific management of ref_children and get_n_children in
	HailCaption. It's already handled in GailContainer
	
	* Added AtkAction support to HailCaption, exposing the click event
	over the label.
	
	* Expose the HildonCaption status as the AtkState
	ATK_STATE_REQUIRED.
	
	* More style fixes
	
	* Added new unit tests for HildonCaption

2005-12-14  

	* Implemented AtkAction interface for HildonAppView in HailAppView.

	* Changed LDFLAGS with AM_LDFLAGS in ut/Makefile.am to remove a warning.

	* Added unit tests for HildonApp Atk support.

	* Added a new factory setup macro for external factories (for example
	Gail ones).

	* Added factory set up to let GailWindow implement Atk for HildonApp.
	It provides HildonApp Atk support.

2005-12-12  

	* Added an explanation of the tasks to implement a hail object.

	* Added a description of what's implemented in hail to reuse it properly

	(implemented interfaces in 1st milestone)

	* Implemented a working environment for unit tests with outo

	* Now you can establish in configure where's the gail source code

	* Improved gtk-doc structure (now it builds api, and it has
	a start of design issues document).

2005-11-14  

	First release. Only built compilation structure.
