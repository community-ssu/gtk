This directory contains the HAIL library.

HAIL (Hildon Accessibility Implementation Library) provides
accessibility support for the set of Hildon widgets present
in hildon-lgpl, hildon-libs and hildon-fm.

Dependencies
============

HAIL depends on these libraries:
- Autotools
- Gtk 2.6 (Maemo version)
- Atk 1.0
- Hildon libraries: hildon-libs and hildon-fm
- Gail source code (at least 1.8.4)
- Outo framework (at least 0.1.0)

You must build some of these libraries if you want to build hail into
a scratchbox environment. For a complete step by step guide for
building hail into a scratchbox take a look at the the
docs/hail-buildsteps.xml file.

Building
========

To compile a CVS version of hail on your system, you will need to take
several steps to setup the tree for compilation.  You can do all these
steps at once by running:

        cvsroot/hail# ./autogen.sh

Basically this does the following for you:

        cvsroot/hail# aclocal; automake; autoconf

        The above commands create the "configure" script.  Now you
        can run the configure script in cvsroot/hail to create all
        the Makefiles.

Before running autogen.sh or configure, make sure you have libtool
in your path.

Note that autogen.sh runs configure for you.  If you wish to pass
options like --prefix=/usr to configure you can give those options
to autogen.sh and they will be passed on to configure.
