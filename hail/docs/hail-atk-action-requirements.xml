<title> Requirements to implement AtkAction interfaces</title>

<para>Atk actions expose actions for widgets. It's used for buttons and similar, to let the ATK layer launch the actions related to them.</para>

<para>Each action has the following properties:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>A name: a short name of the action</listitem>
<listitem>A description: a verbose description of the action</listitem>
<listitem>A localized name: the name, through the l10n layer.</listitem>
<listitem>A keybinding: the current key binding of the action.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>We should implement at least information for name, and maybe keybinding. All actions have an index, and the methods <function>get_name</function>, <function>get_description</function>, <function>get_localized_name</function> and <function>get_keybinding</function> have an index parameter.</para>

<para>Theres a method get_n_actions, to know how many actions are associated with the widget:</para>

  gint                    (*get_n_actions)     (AtkAction         *action);

</programlisting>

<para>The main thing about actions is the implementation of do_action. This method should launch the correct action for the widget and index. The interface is:</para>

<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  gboolean                (*do_action)         (AtkAction         *action,
                                                gint              i);
]]>
</programlisting>
