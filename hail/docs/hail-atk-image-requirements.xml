<title> Requirements to implement an AtkImage interface</title>

<para><classname>AtkImage</classname> is for components showing image or pixmaps
 on the screen. It offers a textual description, size, and position in the screen. 
It should only be for those widgets showing real information through the image (for
example state or attributting).</para>

<section>
<title>Image description</title>

<para>The most important field for us should be the description. It should show a verbose 
description of the image being shown, representing an alternative way to check the represented
image information (for example, it can be used by screen readers). The method is
<function>get_image_description()</function>.</para>

<para>The image description should try to get the default implementation, and in case this
 is null, add its own information. This is for applications defining an own image
description.</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Position and size</title>

<para>An image should expose its position and size. For widgets with an embedded image exposing
the <classname>AtkImage</classname> interface, should expose position and size of this embedded
image (and not the widget image itself).</para>

<para>Fortunately, the default <classname>GailWidget</classname> implementation returns the
<classname>GtkWidget</classname> position and size for realized widgets. Anyway, if you
don't get the needed information, you can also try to get the relevant information from the
<classname>GdkWindow</classname> of the image you want to position.</para>
