Developer Guidelines

The set of developers for Numerical Python is called the Nummies. 
The chairperson of this group is called the NummieHead. 

A well-behaved Nummie will:

   Fix bugs at will, without prior consultation.

  Add new features only after consultation with other Nummies by using the 
  developer mailing list. You can make a branch in CVS if needed for 
  development. When successful, integrate changes to the main line.

  Not leave the repository in a state where it won't build, ever.  

The NummieHead has a veto on adding features. This provision is intended to
encourage discussion of the "big picture" and the needs of the diverse
customer base.

The Nummies control their own membership, and these rules.

Protocol:

When first met at a International Python Conference, the NummieHead should
be greeted with a salute using more than one finger and the cry,
"Ni-Ni-Numpy"; the reply is "Num-Num-Ni".

The historic roster of NummieHeads is:

Paul F. Dubois, January 2000- April 2003 (self-appointed)
Todd Miller, May 2003-
