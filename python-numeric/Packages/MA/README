If you install MA you will also need the Properites modules.

MA is a drop-in replacement for Numeric. It is documented in the second half 
of the Numeric document.

Please note that there are some semantic differences. The most important is
that slices and index operations on MA arrays yield copies of the contents,
not a reference to the contents.
