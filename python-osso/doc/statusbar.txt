The ``osso`` package
======================

Using ``Statusbar``
-------------------

Methods
-------
*statusbar_send_event*

  This method sends a statusbar event notification over
  the D-BUS. If the applet is not loaded, the statusbar
  application will load it.

  *osso.Statusbar.statusbar_send_event(name, int_arg1,
  int_arg2, string_arg3)*

  - ``name:        The name of the applet that should receive
    the event.``
  - ``int_arg1:    This is the first argument of the event.
    It's interpretation depends on event_type.``
  - ``int_arg2:    This is the second argument of the event.
    It's interpretation depends on event_type.``
  - ``string_arg3: This is the third argument of the event.
    It's interpretation depends on event_type. None can be
    used here.``
