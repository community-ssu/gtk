The ``osso`` package
====================

Using ``DeviceState``
---------------------

Methods in this group offer a convenient way to receive
device status information from lower levels of the system.

Methods
-------
*display_state_on*

  Request to turn on the display as if the user had pressed
  a key or the touch screen. This can be used after completing
  a long operation such as downloading a large file or after
  retrieving e-mails.

  ``osso.DeviceState.display_state_on()``

*display_blanking_pause*

  Request not to blank the display. This method must be called
  again within 60 seconds to renew the request. The method is
  used, for example, by the video player during video playback.
  Also prevents suspending the device.

  ``osso.DeviceState.display_blanking_pause()``

*set_device_state_callback*
  **TODO**

Example
-------
::

  import osso

  def cbfunc(parameter):
    print parameter

  c = osso.Context("TestDeviceState", "0.0.1", False)
  devstat = osso.DeviceState(c)
  devstat.set_device_state_callback(cbfunc, 0, 0, 0, 1, "normal", "Inactivity")
  devstat.display_blanking_pause()
  devstat.display_state_on()

  c.close()
