The ``osso`` package
====================

Using ``Context``
-----------------

The Context module is the heart of all modules nested into
osso package. Before use any other module its necessary to 
initialise the Context, that will be used to tell each other
module's context. An application has only one osso.Context.

Constructor
-----------
*Context*

  Used to initialise the context.

  ``osso.Context(application, version, activation)``

  - ``application: The name of the application. This name
    forms the last part of the default (D-BUS) service name
    of the application. The only valid characters that the
    name may contain are letters a-z and the underscore '_'.``
  - ``version:     The version string of the application. It
    must be comparable with strcmp().``
  - ``activation:  If this is True, then the library assumes
    that the application binary has been launched by the
    D-BUS daemon, and thus will connect to the D-BUS activation
    bus (the D-BUS bus where the D-BUS message that resulted in
    auto-activation of the application came -- either the
    session or system bus). This parameter should always be
    False and considered obsolete, because otherwise LibOSSO
    might behave strangely since it normally uses both session
    and system bus.``
  - ``Returns:     A context to use in later calls to this
    library. None is returned if an error happened.``

Methods
-------
*close*

  The close function is used to free the memory used by Context.

  ``osso.Context.close()``

Example
-------
::

  import osso

  c = osso.Context("TheAppName", "0.0.1", False)
  c.close()
