These are the hildon theme tools
--------------------------------

These tools allow you to create themes for the maemo platform.  They
are intended to support the various theme layout packages (such as
hildon-theme-layout-2 for mistral or hildon-theme-layout-3 for sardine).

See these layout packages for more information on how to create a
actual theme package.
