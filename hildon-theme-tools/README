Creating themes
---------------

Check the documentation on our wiki pages for howtos and instructions about
creating themes. For a start you might want to try out hildon-theme-bootstrap
which is a quick tool for bootstrapping a new theme. This tool will create a
complete theme package directory that can be built directly using the debian
tools.
