TODO:
* Copyright boilerplate

FIX:
* Check for image too large, too small
* Check for forbidden dirs (thumbnail dir, etc)
* Make tester work in any directory

Open questions:
* Possible gnome-thumbnail gconf script interoperability?
* Move mtime to client API side?
* Forward mime type to thumber?
* Race in fail files?
* Race in thumbnail copy/rename/remove while create
  Markku said filemanager would try to avoid races by removing those thumbs from queue
* Do early unlink for more safety?

DONE:
* Thumbnailer configuration in gconf, Debian postinstall thumbnailer register scripts
* Make debug spam configurable
* Moving and copying support
* Call callback on all errors
* Remote thumbnail transfer to local
* Failed thumbnail handling, cache
* Priority change in queue (for scrolling)
* ID3 handler
* Update uri on move/copy/rename, refactor thumb save functionality to common
* Cache cleaner
* Remove GTK dep from autoconf, add gdk-pixbuf
* add test image missing check
