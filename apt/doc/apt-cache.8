.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBapt\-cache\fR performs a variety of operations on APT's package cache\&. \fBapt\-cache\fR does not manipulate the state of the system but does provide operations to search and generate interesting output from the package metadata\&.

.PP
Unless the \fB\-h\fR, or \fB\-\-help\fR option is given, one of the commands below must be present\&.

.TP
add \fIfile(s)\fR
add adds the named package index files to the package cache\&. This is for debugging only\&.

.TP
gencaches
gencaches performs the same operation as \fBapt\-get check\fR\&. It builds the source and package caches from the sources in \fB\fIsources\&.list\fR\fR(5) and from \fI/var/lib/dpkg/status\fR\&.

.TP
showpkg \fIpkg(s)\fR
showpkg displays information about the packages listed on the command line\&. Remaining arguments are package names\&. The available versions and reverse dependencies of each package listed are listed, as well as forward dependencies for each version\&. Forward (normal) dependencies are those packages upon which the package in question depends; reverse dependencies are those packages that depend upon the package in question\&. Thus, forward dependencies must be satisfied for a package, but reverse dependencies need not be\&. For instance, \fBapt\-cache showpkg libreadline2\fR would produce output similar to the following:


.IP

.nf

Package: libreadline2
Versions: 2\&.1\-12(/var/state/apt/lists/foo_Packages),
Reverse Depends: 
  libreadlineg2,libreadline2
  libreadline2\-altdev,libreadline2
Dependencies:
2\&.1\-12 \- libc5 (2 5\&.4\&.0\-0) ncurses3\&.0 (0 (null))
Provides:
2\&.1\-12 \- 
Reverse Provides: 

.fi
Thus it may be seen that libreadline2, version 2\&.1\-12, depends on libc5 and ncurses3\&.0 which must be installed for libreadline2 to work\&. In turn, libreadlineg2 and libreadline2\-altdev depend on libreadline2\&. If libreadline2 is installed, libc5 and ncurses3\&.0 (and ldso) must also be installed; libreadlineg2 and libreadline2\-altdev do not have to be installed\&. For the specific meaning of the remainder of the output it is best to consult the apt source code\&.

.TP
stats
stats displays some statistics about the cache\&. No further arguments are expected\&. Statistics reported are: 

.RS
.TP 3
\(bu
Total package names is the number of package names found in the cache\&.
.TP
\(bu
Normal packages is the number of regular, ordinary package names; these are packages that bear a one\-to\-one correspondence between their names and the names used by other packages for them in dependencies\&. The majority of packages fall into this category\&.
.TP
\(bu
Pure virtual packages is the number of packages that exist only as a virtual package name; that is, packages only "provide" the virtual package name, and no package actually uses the name\&. For instance, "mail\-transport\-agent" in the Debian GNU/Linux system is a pure virtual package; several packages provide "mail\-transport\-agent", but there is no package named "mail\-transport\-agent"\&.
.TP
\(bu
Single virtual packages is the number of packages with only one package providing a particular virtual package\&. For example, in the Debian GNU/Linux system, "X11\-text\-viewer" is a virtual package, but only one package, xless, provides "X11\-text\-viewer"\&.
.TP
\(bu
Mixed virtual packages is the number of packages that either provide a particular virtual package or have the virtual package name as the package name\&. For instance, in the Debian GNU/Linux system, "debconf" is both an actual package, and provided by the debconf\-tiny package\&.
.TP
\(bu
Missing is the number of package names that were referenced in a dependency but were not provided by any package\&. Missing packages may be in evidence if a full distribution is not accessed, or if a package (real or virtual) has been dropped from the distribution\&. Usually they are referenced from Conflicts statements\&.
.TP
\(bu
Total distinct versions is the number of package versions found in the cache; this value is therefore at least equal to the number of total package names\&. If more than one distribution (both "stable" and "unstable", for instance), is being accessed, this value can be considerably larger than the number of total package names\&.
.TP
\(bu
Total dependencies is the number of dependency relationships claimed by all of the packages in the cache\&.

.TP
showsrc \fIpkg(s)\fR
showsrc displays all the source package records that match the given package names\&. All versions are shown, as well as all records that declare the name to be a Binary\&.

.TP
dump
dump shows a short listing of every package in the cache\&. It is primarily for debugging\&.

.TP
dumpavail
dumpavail prints out an available list to stdout\&. This is suitable for use with \fB\fBdpkg\fR\fR(8) and is used by the \fB\fBdselect\fR\fR(8) method\&.

.TP
unmet
unmet displays a summary of all unmet dependencies in the package cache\&.

.TP
show \fIpkg(s)\fR
show performs a function similar to \fBdpkg \-\-print\-avail\fRi; it displays the package records for the named packages\&.

.TP
search \fIregex [ regex \&.\&.\&. ]\fR
search performs a full text search on all available package lists for the regex pattern given\&. It searches the package names and the descriptions for an occurrence of the regular expression and prints out the package name and the short description\&. If \fB\-\-full\fR is given then output identical to show is produced for each matched package, and if \fB\-\-names\-only\fR is given then the long description is not searched, only the package name is\&.

Separate arguments can be used to specify multiple search patterns that are and'ed together\&.

.TP
depends \fIpkg(s)\fR
depends shows a listing of each dependency a package has and all the possible other packages that can fulfill that dependency\&.

.TP
rdepends \fIpkg(s)\fR
rdepends shows a listing of each reverse dependency a package has\&.

.TP
pkgnames \fI[ prefix ]\fR
This command prints the name of each package in the system\&. The optional argument is a prefix match to filter the name list\&. The output is suitable for use in a shell tab complete function and the output is generated extremely quickly\&. This command is best used with the \fB\-\-generate\fR option\&.

.TP
dotty \fIpkg(s)\fR
dotty takes a list of packages on the command line and generates output suitable for use by dotty from the GraphViz: \fIhttp://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/\fR package\&. The result will be a set of nodes and edges representing the relationships between the packages\&. By default the given packages will trace out all dependent packages; this can produce a very large graph\&. To limit the output to only the packages listed on the command line, set the APT::Cache::GivenOnly option\&.

The resulting nodes will have several shapes; normal packages are boxes, pure provides are triangles, mixed provides are diamonds, missing packages are hexagons\&. Orange boxes mean recursion was stopped [leaf packages], blue lines are pre\-depends, green lines are conflicts\&.

Caution, dotty cannot graph larger sets of packages\&.

.TP
policy \fI[ pkg(s) ]\fR
policy is meant to help debug issues relating to the preferences file\&. With no arguments it will print out the priorities of each source\&. Otherwise it prints out detailed information about the priority selection of the named package\&.

.TP
madison \fI/[ pkg(s) ]\fR
apt\-cache's madison command attempts to mimic the output format and a subset of the functionality of the Debian archive management tool, madison\&. It displays available versions of a package in a tabular format\&. Unlike the original madison, it can only display information for the architecture for which APT has retrieved package lists (APT::Architecture)\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the descriptions indicate the configuration option to set\&. For boolean options you can override the config file by using something like \fB\-f\-\fR,\fB\-\-no\-f\fR, \fB\-f=no\fR or several other variations\&.

.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pkg\-cache\fR
Select the file to store the package cache\&. The package cache is the primary cache used by all operations\&. Configuration Item: Dir::Cache::pkgcache\&.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-src\-cache\fR
Select the file to store the source cache\&. The source is used only by gencaches and it stores a parsed version of the package information from remote sources\&. When building the package cache the source cache is used to advoid reparsing all of the package files\&. Configuration Item: Dir::Cache::srcpkgcache\&.

.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress indicators\&. More q's will produce more quietness up to a maximum of 2\&. You can also use \fB\-q=#\fR to set the quietness level, overriding the configuration file\&. Configuration Item: quiet\&.

.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-important\fR
Print only important dependencies; for use with unmet\&. Causes only Depends and Pre\-Depends relations to be printed\&. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::Important\&.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-full\fR
Print full package records when searching\&. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::ShowFull\&.

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\-versions\fR
Print full records for all available versions\&. This is the default; to turn it off, use \fB\-\-no\-all\-versions\fR\&. If \fB\-\-no\-all\-versions\fR is specified, only the candidate version will displayed (the one which would be selected for installation)\&. This option is only applicable to the show command\&. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::AllVersions\&.

.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-generate\fR
Perform automatic package cache regeneration, rather than use the cache as it is\&. This is the default; to turn it off, use \fB\-\-no\-generate\fR\&. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::Generate\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-names\-only\fR, \fB\-n\fR
Only search on the package names, not the long descriptions\&. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::NamesOnly\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-all\-names\fR
Make pkgnames print all names, including virtual packages and missing dependencies\&. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::AllNames\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-recurse\fR
Make depends and rdepends recursive so that all packages mentioned are printed once\&. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::RecurseDepends\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-installed\fR
Limit the output of depends and rdepends to packages which are currently installed\&. Configuration Item: APT::Cache::Installed\&.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show a short usage summary\&.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show the program version\&.

.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\-file\fR
Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use\&. The program will read the default configuration file and then this configuration file\&. See \fB\fIapt\&.conf\fR\fR(5) for syntax information\&.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-option\fR
Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitary configuration option\&. The syntax is \fB\-o Foo::Bar=bar\fR\&.

.SH "FILES"

.TP
\fI/etc/apt/sources\&.list\fR
Locations to fetch packages from\&. Configuration Item: Dir::Etc::SourceList\&.

.TP
\fI/var/lib/apt/lists/\fR
Storage area for state information for each package resource specified in \fB\fIsources\&.list\fR\fR(5) Configuration Item: Dir::State::Lists\&.

.TP
\fI/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/\fR
Storage area for state information in transit\&. Configuration Item: Dir::State::Lists (implicit partial)\&.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.PP
\fB\fIapt\&.conf\fR\fR(5), \fB\fIsources\&.list\fR\fR(5), \fB\fBapt\-get\fR\fR(8) 

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
