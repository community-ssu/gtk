.SH NAME
sources.list \- Package resource list for APT
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The package resource list is used to locate archives of the package distribution system in use on the system\&. At this time, this manual page documents only the packaging system used by the Debian GNU/Linux system\&. This control file is located in \fI/etc/apt/sources\&.list\fR

.PP
The source list is designed to support any number of active sources and a variety of source media\&. The file lists one source per line, with the most preferred source listed first\&. The format of each line is: type uri args The first item, type determines the format for args  uri is a Universal Resource Identifier (URI), which is a superset of the more specific and well\-known Universal Resource Locator, or URL\&. The rest of the line can be marked as a comment by using a #\&.

.SH "THE DEB AND DEB-SRC TYPES"

.PP
The deb type describes a typical two\-level Debian archive, \fIdistribution/component\fR\&. Typically, distribution is generally one of stable  unstable or testing while component is one of main  contrib  non\-free or non\-us The deb\-src type describes a debian distribution's source code in the same form as the deb type\&. A deb\-src line is required to fetch source indexes\&.

.PP
The format for a \fIsources\&.list\fR entry using the deb and deb\-src types are:

.nf
deb uri distribution [component1] [component2] [\&.\&.\&.]
.fi

.PP
The URI for the deb type must specify the base of the Debian distribution, from which APT will find the information it needs\&. distribution can specify an exact path, in which case the components must be omitted and distribution must end with a slash (/)\&. This is useful for when only a particular sub\-section of the archive denoted by the URI is of interest\&. If distribution does not specify an exact path, at least one component must be present\&.

.PP
distribution may also contain a variable, $(ARCH) which expands to the Debian architecture (i386, m68k, powerpc, \&.\&.\&.) used on the system\&. This permits architecture\-independent \fIsources\&.list\fR files to be used\&. In general this is only of interest when specifying an exact path, APT will automatically generate a URI with the current architecture otherwise\&.

.PP
Since only one distribution can be specified per line it may be necessary to have multiple lines for the same URI, if a subset of all available distributions or components at that location is desired\&. APT will sort the URI list after it has generated a complete set internally, and will collapse multiple references to the same Internet host, for instance, into a single connection, so that it does not inefficiently establish an FTP connection, close it, do something else, and then re\-establish a connection to that same host\&. This feature is useful for accessing busy FTP sites with limits on the number of simultaneous anonymous users\&. APT also parallelizes connections to different hosts to more effectively deal with sites with low bandwidth\&.

.PP
It is important to list sources in order of preference, with the most preferred source listed first\&. Typically this will result in sorting by speed from fastest to slowest (CD\-ROM followed by hosts on a local network, followed by distant Internet hosts, for example)\&.

.PP
Some examples:

.nf

deb http://http\&.us\&.debian\&.org/debian stable main contrib non\-free
deb http://http\&.us\&.debian\&.org/debian dists/stable\-updates/
   
.fi

.SH "URI SPECIFICATION"

.PP
The currently recognized URI types are cdrom, file, http, and ftp\&. 

.TP
file
The file scheme allows an arbitrary directory in the file system to be considered an archive\&. This is useful for NFS mounts and local mirrors or archives\&.

.TP
cdrom
The cdrom scheme allows APT to use a local CDROM drive with media swapping\&. Use the \fB\fBapt\-cdrom\fR\fR(8) program to create cdrom entries in the source list\&.

.TP
http
The http scheme specifies an HTTP server for the archive\&. If an environment variable \fBhttp_proxy\fR is set with the format http://server:port/, the proxy server specified in \fBhttp_proxy\fR will be used\&. Users of authenticated HTTP/1\&.1 proxies may use a string of the format http://user:pass@server:port/ Note that this is an insecure method of authentication\&.

.TP
ftp
The ftp scheme specifies an FTP server for the archive\&. APT's FTP behavior is highly configurable; for more information see the \fB\fIapt\&.conf\fR\fR(5) manual page\&. Please note that a ftp proxy can be specified by using the \fBftp_proxy\fR environment variable\&. It is possible to specify a http proxy (http proxy servers often understand ftp urls) using this method and ONLY this method\&. ftp proxies using http specified in the configuration file will be ignored\&.

.TP
copy
The copy scheme is identical to the file scheme except that packages are copied into the cache directory instead of used directly at their location\&. This is useful for people using a zip disk to copy files around with APT\&.

.TP
rsh, ssh
The rsh/ssh method invokes rsh/ssh to connect to a remote host as a given user and access the files\&. No password authentication is possible, prior arrangements with RSA keys or rhosts must have been made\&. Access to files on the remote uses standard \fBfind\fR and \fBdd\fR commands to perform the file transfers from the remote\&.
 

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.PP
Uses the archive stored locally (or NFS mounted) at /home/jason/debian for stable/main, stable/contrib, and stable/non\-free\&.

.nf
deb file:/home/jason/debian stable main contrib non\-free
.fi

.PP
As above, except this uses the unstable (development) distribution\&.

.nf
deb file:/home/jason/debian unstable main contrib non\-free
.fi

.PP
Source line for the above

.nf
deb\-src file:/home/jason/debian unstable main contrib non\-free
.fi

.PP
Uses HTTP to access the archive at archive\&.debian\&.org, and uses only the hamm/main area\&.

.nf
deb http://archive\&.debian\&.org/debian\-archive hamm main
.fi

.PP
Uses FTP to access the archive at ftp\&.debian\&.org, under the debian directory, and uses only the stable/contrib area\&.

.nf
deb ftp://ftp\&.debian\&.org/debian stable contrib
.fi

.PP
Uses FTP to access the archive at ftp\&.debian\&.org, under the debian directory, and uses only the unstable/contrib area\&. If this line appears as well as the one in the previous example in \fIsources\&.list\fR\&. a single FTP session will be used for both resource lines\&.

.nf
deb ftp://ftp\&.debian\&.org/debian unstable contrib
.fi

.PP
Uses HTTP to access the archive at nonus\&.debian\&.org, under the debian\-non\-US directory\&.

.nf
deb http://nonus\&.debian\&.org/debian\-non\-US stable/non\-US main contrib non\-free
.fi

.PP
Uses HTTP to access the archive at nonus\&.debian\&.org, under the debian\-non\-US directory, and uses only files found under \fIunstable/binary\-i3866\fR on i386 machines, \fIunstable/binary\-m68k\fR on m68k, and so forth for other supported architectures\&. [Note this example only illustrates how to use the substitution variable; non\-us is no longer structured like this] 

.nf
deb http://ftp\&.de\&.debian\&.org/debian\-non\-US unstable/binary\-$(ARCH)/
.fi
