.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBapt\-cdrom\fR
is used to add a new CDROM to APTs list of available sources.
\fBapt\-cdrom\fR
takes care of determining the structure of the disc as well as correcting for several possible mis\-burns and verifying the index files.
.PP
It is necessary to use
\fBapt\-cdrom\fR
to add CDs to the APT system, it cannot be done by hand. Furthermore each disk in a multi\-cd set must be inserted and scanned separately to account for possible mis\-burns.
.PP
Unless the
\fB\-h\fR, or
\fB\-\-help\fR
option is given one of the commands below must be present.
.PP
add
.RS 3n
add
is used to add a new disc to the source list. It will unmount the CDROM device, prompt for a disk to be inserted and then procceed to scan it and copy the index files. If the disc does not have a proper
\fIdisk\fR
directory you will be prompted for a descriptive title.
.sp
APT uses a CDROM ID to track which disc is currently in the drive and maintains a database of these IDs in
\fI/var/lib/apt/cdroms.list\fR
.RE
.PP
ident
.RS 3n
A debugging tool to report the identity of the current disc as well as the stored file name
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the descriptions indicate the configuration option to set. For boolean options you can override the config file by using something like
\fB\-f\-\fR,\fB\-\-no\-f\fR,
\fB\-f=no\fR
or several other variations.
.PP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-cdrom\fR
.RS 3n
Mount point; specify the location to mount the cdrom. This mount point must be listed in
\fI/etc/fstab\fR
and properly configured. Configuration Item:
Acquire::cdrom::mount.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-rename\fR
.RS 3n

.RE
.PP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-no\-mount\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fast\fR
.RS 3n

has been run on this disc before and did not detect any errors. Configuration Item:
APT::CDROM::Fast.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-thorough\fR
.RS 3n
