  * Updated Simplified Chinese translation of message catalog from Tchaikov
    <chaisave@263.net> (Closes: #234186)

  * Add an assert() to make sure that we don't overflow a fixed-size
    buffer in the very unlikely event that someone adds 10 packaging
    systems to apt (Closes: #233678)
  * Fix whitespace in French translation of "Yes, do as I say!", which

  * Make debian/rules a bit more consistent in a few places.
    Specifically, always use -p$@ rather than an explicit package name,
    and always specify it first, and use dh_shlibdeps -l uniformly rather
    than sometimes changing LD_LIBRARY_PATH directly
  * Document unit for Cache-Limit (bytes) (Closes: #234737)

apt (0.5.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Eric Wong <normalperson@yhbt.net> to include apt18n.h after
    other headers to avoid breaking locale.h when setlocale() is defined
    as an empty macro.  This was not a problem on Debian, but broke
    compilation on Solaris. (Closes: #226509)

    doesn't meet version requirements (Closes: #214736)
  * Fix version display for recommends (Closes: #219900)
  * Use isatty rather than ttyname for checking if stdin is a terminal.
    isatty has the advantage of not requiring /proc under Linux, and thus
    Closes: #221728
  * Correctly implement -n as a synonym for --names-only (Closes: #224515)
  * Update apt-cache(8)

apt (0.5.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-get build-dep, when trying to skip over the remaining elements of

    later item in the or-expression.  Fixed it.
  * Let apt-get build-dep try alternatives if the first dependency in an
    or-expression is not available
  * Add a Debug::BuildDeps to generate some trace output
  * Help apt-get build-dep produce more useful error messages
  * Process build-dependencies in forward rather than reverse order
  * Error out if an installed package is too new for a << or <=
    build-dependency
  * apt-get build-dep should now be able to handle almost any package with
    correct build-depends.  The primary exception is build-dependencies on
    virtual packages with more than one provider, and these are
    discouraged for automated processing (but still common,

    This broke builds where the clean target was run with different
    privileges than the rest of the build (i.e., root) (Closes: #212183)
  * On second thought, don't copy config.guess and config.sub at all.  I'd

    (apt-cdrom, apt-extracttemplates, apt-sortpkgs)
  * Change upgraded/newly installed/not fully installed or removed
    messages to be consistent and somewhat shorter (some translations
    exceeded 80 characters even in the simplest case)

  * Move the French apt-ftparchive man page into apt-utils where it
    belongs.  apt-utils Replaces: apt (<< 0.5.9)

    suggests/recommends for packages which are selected for installation
    at the same time as the package which suggests/recommends them
    (Closes: #200102)
  * Patch from Otavio Salvador <otavio@debian.org> to avoid listing
    suggests/recommends which are Provided by a package which is already
    installed (Closes: #200395)
  * Patch to update pt_BR man page for apt_preferences(5) from Andre Luis
    Lopes <andrelop@debian.org> (Closes: #202245)
  * Use nl_langinfo(YESEXPR) rather than comparing to the translated
    string "Y".  Closes: #200953 and should make the prompting generally
    more robust in the face of i18n.  In the particular case of #200953,
    it was being fooled because of signedness issues with toupper(3)

  * apt Suggests: aptitude | synaptic | gnome-apt | wajig
    (Closes: #146667)

  * Use debian/compat rather than DH_COMPAT
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level 3
    - remove ldconfig calls from debian/{postinst,postrm} as dh_makeshlibs
      will add them
    - echo 3 > debian/compat
    - Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 3)
  * Exclude '.#*' from cvs-build
  * Let the ftp method work with ftp servers which do not require a
    password (Closes: #199425)
  * Build-depend on debhelper >= 4.1.62, because we need the fix for
    #204731 in order for dh_installman to work correctly
    with our SGML man pages
  * Move dh_makeshlibs ahead of dh_installdeb so that its postinst
    fragments are properly substituted

apt (0.5.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * urgency=medium because the changes since 0.5.5.1 are pretty safe as
    far as core functionality, 0.5.5.1 survived unstable for 10 days, and
    I don't want to delay apt's progress into testing any further.  It's
    decidedly better than 0.5.4.
  * Clarify the meaning of the only-source option in apt-get(8)

    configuration item (Closes: #168453)
  * Improve build-depends handling of virtual packages even further, so that
    it will now also try to satisfy build-depends on virtual packages if they
    are not installed.  Note that this only works if there is only one

    YnPrompt works correctly (Closes: #200953).  No other translations seem
    to have this problem
  * Regenerate POT file and sync .po files
  * Only try to clear stdin if it is a tty, to avoid looping if there is
    lots of stuff (perhaps an infinite amount) to read (Closes: #192228)
