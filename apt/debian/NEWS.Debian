apt (0.5.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-ftparchive --db now uses Berkeley DB version 4.2.  If used with a
    database created by an older version of apt, an attempt will be made
    to upgrade the database, but this may not work in all cases.  If your
    database is not automatically upgraded, delete it and allow it to be
    recreated the next time.
