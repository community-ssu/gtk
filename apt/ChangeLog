	* apt-pkg/acquire-item.cc (pkgAcqMetaSig::pkgAcqMetaSig): Don't
	move old version into partial/, we need it as a backup in the case
	the acquiring fails.
	(pkgAcqMetaSig::Custom600Headers): Updated to find the old
	version.
	(pkgAcqMetaSig::Done): Make sure that the file is in partial/ and
	no longer in lists/.
	(pkgAcqMetaSig::Failed): Use the old, existing version for a
	transient acquire failure.
	(pkgAcqMetaIndex::Failed): Likewise, start the gpgv pass for a
	transient failure when we have an old version and a signature
	file.
