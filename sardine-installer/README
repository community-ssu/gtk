Sardine Installer
-----------------

This is a small package that allows you to install Sardine (the
bleeding edge maemo distribution for the Nokia 770) on your MMC.

The theory of operation is as follows:

- Installing this package gives you a program named
  "sardine-installer" that can be run from the command line.

- The sardine-installer will format your first partition on your MMC
  as an ext2 filesystem and extract the Sardine root filesystem onto it.

- The Sardine root filesystem is downloaded and extracted on the fly.

- You also get the select-root-device program that will allow you to
  change the device that your device boots from.

- The sardine-installer will use that program to set the root device
  to "mmc".

It is recommended that you flash the "bootmenu initfs".  More about
this later.
